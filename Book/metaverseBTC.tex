\section{Abstract}
We present a state of the art and positioning paper about Web3, Bitcoin, and `Metaverse'; describing the intersections and synergies. A high level overview of Web3 technologies leads to a description of blockchain, and the Bitcoin network is specifically selected for detailed examination. Suitable components of the extended Bitcoin ecosystem are described in more depth. Other mechanisms for native digital value transfer are described, with a focus on `money'. Metaverse technology is over-viewed, primarily from the perspective of Bitcoin and extended reality.\\
Bitcoin is selected as the best contender for value transfer in metaverses because of it's free and open source nature, and network effect. Challenges and risks of this approach are identified. A cloud / virtual machine technology stack can be downloaded and deployed from GitHub to experiment with the technologies, with a focus on cybersecurity best practice. This deployable lab is designed to inform development of secure value transaction, for small and medium sized companies. Next steps are touched upon in the conclusion.\\
\textbf{This is an incomplete document and may frankly contain a bunch of errors. Usual v0.1 caveats apply. It's 100\% opensource (unlicense) so if something seems wrong pertaining to your project, or you have a suggestion for an improvement, then submit a PR to GitHub. There's a bunch of place holder text using the Lorem Ipsum insert from LaTeX. If you see that, skip to the end of the section. Targeting April 2022 for a final draft. 20 working days left.}
\section{Introduction}
This document presents a high level view of technologies and potential within the emergent Web3 and metaverse narrative, focusing around the transmission of value within and across such global networks, with a further focus on the Bitcoin monetary network. It was written to organise the thoughts of the authors, who were unfamiliar with Bitcoin technologies until recently.\\
As adoption of these technologies increases it will be necessary for people, and AI actors, to pass economic value between themselves. These `goods and services' interactions, within the virtual social spaces, should be underpinned by a trust system, which scales globally, and presents low friction. Current secure international payment rails are poorly suited to such interactions; indeed it is likely with legacy systems, that parties would be forced to leave the metaverse application, and instead navigate their banking applications to exchange value with overseas entities in a secure fashion. This might conceivably take several days.\\ 
The whole landscape of money and \href{https://www.omfif.org/futureofpayments2021/}{value transfer is changing}. This is has immediate implications for SMEs. It is timely then to explore the potential of recent technologies, which can address metaverse interactions in \textit{business to business} (B2B), \textit{business to customer} (B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; \textit{creator to consumer, customer to customer, consumer to consumer\cite{jones2008trust})}. Figure \ref{fig:landscapevenn} demonstrates how some of these domains intersect. This paper seeks to overview and explain the available open source technologies. It supports an open source \href{https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse}{github repository} which enables SMEs to access these emergent platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build toward a minimum viable product for trust minimised transfer of value within a social immersive space.\\
Referencing is in two styles; academic works are numeric, while opinion pieces, grey stats, and pertinent news articles are hyperlinked in blue from the text. As the paper develops the veracity of the citations should improve. It is likely that this document is incomplete as you are reading it as it's designed to be an open ended and open source resource. It is an experiment in a living document and repository.

\subsection{Overview}\label{overview}}

This document details the process of creating the system detailed in the
accompanying paper. It is intended to be complete. It is a how to guide.

\hypertarget{summary-of-software}{%
\subsubsection{Summary of software}\label{summary-of-software}}

Summarise the software and functionality

\hypertarget{prerequisites}{%
\subsection{Prerequisites}\label{prerequisites}}

Ensure that the BIOS / firmware / etc of the hardware you intend to use
is up to date.

\hypertarget{network-details}{%
\subsection{Network details}\label{network-details}}

In the example setup provided here there are currently two networks:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The virtual server resides in a LAN with the following details:
\end{enumerate}

192.168.x.0/24

Replace x with an integer between 0 and 254

This LAN has a gateway to the Internet and DNS server configured. Of
course, it could be replaced with a direct connection to the Internet,
though for research and development purposes it is often better to work
within a clean LAN and manage access to the Internet as required.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\tightlist
\item
  There is a virtual network configured on the virtual machine host upon
  which virtual machines can reside:
\end{enumerate}

This virtual network is not configured to bridge with the physical
network adapter rather a virtual machine is configured as a gateway to
route IP traffic through. This provides a level of isolation. More on
this later (@todo).

\subsection{Proxmox VE}\label{proxmox-ve}}

\hypertarget{installation-and-configuration}{%
\subsubsection{Installation and
configuration}\label{installation-and-configuration}}

Version used: 7.1

Keep in mind that this setup uses the Proxmox VE installer
(https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve/get-started) which, as noted on
the site, is a bare-metal installer and will erase all data on at least
one disk. There are alternative methods to install Proxmox VE but these
are not covered here.

A brief summary of the steps taken using Proxmox VE 7.1:

\hypertarget{dialogue-1}{%
\paragraph{Dialogue 1}\label{dialogue-1}}

Choose the target harddisk (/dev/sda in this case).

\hypertarget{dialogue-2}{%
\paragraph{Dialogue 2}\label{dialogue-2}}

Select country, time zone, keyboard layout.

\hypertarget{dialogue-3}{%
\paragraph{Dialogue 3}\label{dialogue-3}}

Set a password (this is the root password, see proxmox hardening
section), and email address.

\hypertarget{dialogue-4}{%
\paragraph{Dialogue 4}\label{dialogue-4}}

Select a Network Interface Card (NIC) on which the management interface
will be available and provide a hostname, IP address, gateway and DNS
server.

In this example the following settings were used:

Hostname: proxmoximus.local IP address: 192.168.x.220 / 24 Gateway:
192.168.x.254 DNS server: 192.168.x.254

Either replace x with the integer used earlier and update the last octet
of the gateway and server with that that corresponds to your setup
(assuming the setup is local and has a local dns server or forwarder) or
configure the values according to your intended setup.

Once the install has completed and the system has rebooted it is time to
begin configuring. This is done (almost entirely) via the web interface,
in this case, available at https:// proxmoximus \textbar{} 192.168.x.220
: 8006

It is also possible to login to a shell via the local terminal and SSH
(which is enabled by default @todo: in hardening, add keys and remove
ability to login with password).

\hypertarget{software-updates}{%
\subsubsection{Software updates}\label{software-updates}}

If you are in a testing and non-production environment then it is
possible access updates without a subscription as detailed here:
https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Package\_Repositories. Update
\texttt{/etc/apt/sources.list} as detailed under the Proxmox VE
No-Subscription Repository. This can be achieved via the local terminal,
SSH or web interface (via Shell option).

For example, edit the file:

\texttt{nano\ /etc/apt/sources.list}

Add the following:

\begin{verbatim}
# PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription
\end{verbatim}

To the existing:

\begin{verbatim}
deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib

deb http://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org bullseye-security main contrib
\end{verbatim}

Resulting in:

\begin{verbatim}
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bullseye main contrib
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian bullseye-updates main contrib

# PVE pve-no-subscription repository provided by proxmox.com,
# NOT recommended for production use
deb http://download.proxmox.com/debian/pve bullseye pve-no-subscription

# security updates
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security bullseye-security main contrib
\end{verbatim}

The Proxmox VE system will now retrieve updates for both itself and the
base Debian system.

Then from a shell run:

\begin{verbatim}
$ apt update
$ apt upgrade
\end{verbatim}

@todo: determine if system needs a reboot

\hypertarget{proxmox-ve-hardening}{%

Add SSH keys and remove ability to login with password

\hypertarget{setup-an-internal-only-network-in-proxmox-ve}{%
\subsection{Setup an internal only network in Proxmox
VE}\label{setup-an-internal-only-network-in-proxmox-ve}}

From the Web GUI navigate to Datacenter - \textgreater{} your server
-\textgreater{} Network

From the menu select Create then Linux Bridge

Input the desired IPv4/CIDR in this case 192.168.y.0/24 and add a
comment if desired (``Internal network'' was used here). Note that y
must not be the same as x previously used.

Name was left as vmbr1

@todo: the built version seemed to be a nightly release, is it possible
to add a tag to get a stable build?

Follow the build instructions:

https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/contributing/build-vyos.html

This document does not list this version (goes up to 10 ``buster'') but
Debian 11 ``bullseye'' was successfully used in this setup.

Run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
$ apt install git
$ apt install build-essential
\end{verbatim}

Follow the instructions here
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/ to install Docker

Run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone -b equuleus --single-branch https://github.com/vyos/vyos-build

$ docker run --rm -it --privileged -v $(pwd):/vyos -w /vyos vyos/vyos-build:equuleus bash
\end{verbatim}

Then in the Docker terminal run the following commands:

\begin{verbatim}
./configure --architecture amd64

sudo make iso
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{upload-the-iso-image-to-the-proxmox-ve-server}{%
\subsubsection{Upload the ISO image to the Proxmox VE
server}\label{upload-the-iso-image-to-the-proxmox-ve-server}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Via the web GUI navigate to Datacenter -\textgreater{} your server
  -\textgreater{} local.
\item
  In the right hand pane select ISO Images and then upload.
\item
  Upload the ISO image
\end{enumerate}

Tip: you can also pass the checksum to the Proxmox VE upload tool

\hypertarget{create-vyos-virtual-machine}{%
\subsubsection{Create VyOS virtual
machine}\label{create-vyos-virtual-machine}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  From the top right of the web GUI select Create VM
\item
  In the appearing dialogue type a Name ``VyOS'' and optionally select
  advanced and Start at boot
\item
  On the next tab select the target ISO image
\item
  On the System tab leave everything as default
\item
  n the Disk tab leave the defaults (this exceeds requirements
  https://docs.vyos.io/en/latest/installation/install.html)
\item
  On the CPU tab:

  Sockets: 1, Cores: 2
\item
  On the Memory tab

  Memory: 4096MiB
\item
  On the Network tab

  Choose the bridge with the internet vmbr0 (it is possible to add the
  second later) and leave the defaults including firewall

  Confirm all the settings on the next tab but \textbf{do not} select
  start after created

  Navigate to the newly created VM on the left-hand pane then selected
  Hardware from the menu that is presented on the right. Choose Add and
  then Network Device. In the dialogue that appears select the Internal
  network bridge (vmbr1 in this case) that was created earlier and leave
  all other options as is.

  So, the VM will have the following Network Devices:

  net0: Internet

  net1: Internal only
\item
  Start the VM and connect the console (top right)
\item
  Login with vyos and vyos

  Run the command:

\begin{verbatim}
$ install image
\end{verbatim}
\item
  Follow the instructions
\item
  Set the CD/DVD to none in Web GUI
\item
  Reboot
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{configure-vyos}{%
\subsubsection{Configure VyOS}\label{configure-vyos}}

Open a noVNC window to the host

Login with vyos and vyos

Switch to configure mode:

\begin{verbatim}
vyos@vyos$ configure
vyos@vyos#
\end{verbatim}

Then configure as desired. Below is configuration used in the setup here
(if you use for inspiration do take care to replace the x and y octet
values correctly with previously chosen values):

\begin{verbatim}
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address '192.168.x.221/24'
set interfaces ethernet eth0 description 'OUTSIDE'
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.x.254 distance 1
set service dns forwarding system
set service dns forwarding name-server 192.168.x.254
set service dns forwarding listen-address 192.168.y.1
set service dns forwarding allow-from 192.168.y.0/24
set system name -server 192.168.x.254

set interfaces ethernet eth1 address '192.168.y.1/24'
set interfaces ethernet eth1 description 'INSIDE'

set nat source rule 100 outbound-interface eth0
set nat source rule 100 source address 192.168.y.0/24
set nat source rule 100 translation address masquerade

set service ssh listen-address 0.0.0.0
\end{verbatim}

Once done remember to commit the config (correcting any
misconfiguration) and save.

\begin{verbatim}
commit
save
\end{verbatim}

Inspiration for the above was taken from:
