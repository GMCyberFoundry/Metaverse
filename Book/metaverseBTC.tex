\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Abstract}
We present a state of the art and positioning paper about Web3, Bitcoin, and `Metaverse'; describing the intersections and synergies. A high level overview of Web3 technologies leads to a description of blockchain, and the Bitcoin network is specifically selected for detailed examination. Suitable components of the extended Bitcoin ecosystem are described in more depth. Other mechanisms for native digital value transfer are described, with a focus on `money'. Metaverse technology is over-viewed, primarily from the perspective of Bitcoin and extended reality.\\
Bitcoin is selected as the best contender for value transfer in metaverses because of it's free and open source nature, and network effect. Challenges and risks of this approach are identified. A cloud / virtual machine technology stack can be downloaded and deployed from GitHub to experiment with the technologies, with a focus on cybersecurity best practice. This deployable lab is designed to inform development of secure value transaction, for small and medium sized companies. Next steps are touched upon in the conclusion.\\
\textbf{This is an incomplete document and may frankly contain a bunch of errors. Usual v0.1 caveats apply. It's 100\% opensource (unlicense) so if something seems wrong pertaining to your project, or you have a suggestion for an improvement, then submit a PR to GitHub. There's a bunch of place holder text using the Lorem Ipsum insert from LaTeX. If you see that, skip to the end of the section. Targeting April 2022 for a final draft. 20 working days left.}
\section{Introduction}
This document presents a high level view of technologies and potential within the emergent Web3 and metaverse narrative, focusing around the transmission of value within and across such global networks, with a further focus on the Bitcoin monetary network. It was written to organise the thoughts of the authors, who were unfamiliar with Bitcoin technologies until recently.\\
As adoption of these technologies increases it will be necessary for people, and AI actors, to pass economic value between themselves. These `goods and services' interactions, within the virtual social spaces, should be underpinned by a trust system, which scales globally, and presents low friction. Current secure international payment rails are poorly suited to such interactions; indeed it is likely with legacy systems, that parties would be forced to leave the metaverse application, and instead navigate their banking applications to exchange value with overseas entities in a secure fashion. This might conceivably take several days.\\ 
The whole landscape of money and \href{https://www.omfif.org/futureofpayments2021/}{value transfer is changing}. This is has immediate implications for SMEs. It is timely then to explore the potential of recent technologies, which can address metaverse interactions in \textit{business to business} (B2B), \textit{business to customer} (B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; \textit{creator to consumer, customer to customer, consumer to consumer\cite{jones2008trust})}. Figure \ref{fig:landscapevenn} demonstrates how some of these domains intersect. This paper seeks to overview and explain the available open source technologies. It supports an open source \href{https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse}{github repository} which enables SMEs to access these emergent platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build toward a minimum viable product for trust minimised transfer of value within a social immersive space.\\
Referencing is in two styles; academic works are numeric, while opinion pieces, grey stats, and pertinent news articles are hyperlinked in blue from the text. As the paper develops the veracity of the citations should improve. It is likely that this document is incomplete as you are reading it as it's designed to be an open ended and open source resource. It is an experiment in a living document and repository.

\subsection{Global course delivery}
\begin{itemize}
\item Elements for the infrastructure: Economic layer, asset layer, content interface, user management, data storage, microsites loaded in Wolvin and webm, accessibility schema, network security, backups, secure messaging. Deployable framework with high modularity. Some more ossified elements for surity, some less so for malleability and open opportunity. Figure \ref{fig:globalclassroom}.
\item Education in XR, how to we develop a platform, marketplace, framework for open contribution.
\item WebXR, Vircadia, any snap in metaverse middleware that is free and opensource (action to compare the two). 
\item Define an interface schema for bolting in any commercial or FOSS metaverse engine.
\item VR marketplace (outside the scope of the VR engine) without a trusted third party.
\item Cryptographically managed learning deliverables (coursework as NFT). 
\item Secure messaging and group messaging using cryptographic keys. Check this stuff with the distributed computing science people in the group (action on John)
\item work toward an exemplar MVP which is then "in the wild"
\item Platform for educators
\item Define scheme, documentation, best practice, interfaces, functional objects, pedagogy, accessibility, multi-language. 
\item Define user management system for educators and client learners.
\item Identify the pain points which current FOSS elements which need development time/money
\item separate the UI/engine from the graphical assets, and the educational / pedagogical components, accessibility, and the value and asset transfer layers.
\item Desktop systems are the primary target (low end system)
\item define schema for accessibility. Colour, subtitles, immersion concerns which can be applied to metaverse rooms through API?
\item Start to define the hybrid presentation model we favour. Avatars? Microsites? A combination of the two? Balance of guided vs unguided experience. Do we need to test the correct way to do delivery? Is there prior art we can draw on? I feel I should know. Is this part of the research that's being done here?
\item Big work package on schema vs key and user management to enforce rules in spaces. Only participants who have provably paid should have access to learning material, the ability to input into the assessment system, and the tokenised learning outcome `NFT' or proof.
\item Proof that XR system improve learning outcomes. Also that the proposed systems for micro-transactions and user and schema management give additional headroom for teaching.
\end{itemize}

Notes on buildout
The world database in the shared rooms in the metaverse is the global object master,  educational materials, videos,  audio content and branded objects are fungible tokens authentically proved by rgb client side validation between parties,  only validated ones will be persisted in shared rooms like conferences and classes according to the room schema. That allows educators to monetise their content.  That can work on lightning.  Nft objects between parties like content crafted by participants (coursework, homework) are not on lightning and will attract main chain fees but are rarer. User authentication and communication will be through nostr.
