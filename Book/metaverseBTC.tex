\section{Introduction}
This document presents a high level view of technologies and their potential within the emergent Web3 and metaverse narrative, focusing around the transmission of value within and across such global networks, with a further focus on the Bitcoin monetary network. It was written to organise the thoughts of the authors, who were unfamiliar with Bitcoin technologies until recently.\par
As adoption of these technologies increases it will be necessary for people, and AI actors, to pass economic value between themselves. These `goods and services' interactions, within the virtual social spaces should be underpinned by a trust system, which scales globally and presents low friction. Current secure international payment rails are poorly suited to such interactions; indeed it is likely with legacy systems, that parties would be forced to leave the metaverse application, and instead navigate their banking applications to exchange value with overseas entities in a secure fashion. This might conceivably take several days.\par 
Fortunately, the whole landscape of money and \href{https://www.omfif.org/futureofpayments2021/}{value transfer is changing}. Huge global financial players are entering the space. HSBC have \href{https://sandboxgame.medium.com/hsbc-to-become-the-first-global-financial-services-provider-to-enter-the-sandbox-c066e4f48163}{just bought} metaverse `land' in The Sandbox, JP Morgan have \href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2022/02/16/jpmorgan-opens-a-bank-branch-in-the-metaverse-but-its-not-for-what-you-think-its-for/?sh=2fbd1e90158d}{opened a `lounge'} in another. The worlds largest hedge fund Bridgewater is stepping into \href{https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-latest-price-crypto-ray-dalio-bridgewater-investment-fund-ethereum-094946686.html}{acquisition of digital assets}, and the world's largest pension fund manager Blackrock is adding these asset to their management engine (which manages tens of trillions of dollars). Fidelity asset management are about to add \href{https://www.wsj.com/articles/fidelity-to-allow-retirement-savers-to-put-bitcoin-in-401-k-accounts-11650945661}{Bitcoin to their pension plans} and are offering a \href{}{dedicated metaverse tradable fund}, while \href{https://www.citivelocity.com/citigps/metaverse-and-money/}{Citigroup have a minisite} dedicated to ``Metaverse and Money''. The front page of Goldman Sachs recently says it all (Figure \ref{fig:goldmanFront}).\par
\begin{figure}[ht]\centering % Using \begin{figure*} makes the figure take up the entire width of the page
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{goldmanFront}
	\caption{The landing page of global\\financial giant Goldman Sachs shows the hype.}
	\label{fig:goldmanFront}
\end{figure}
Of their recent investments KPMG global said: \textit{``We've invested in a strong cryptoassets practice and we will continue to enhance and build on our capabilities across Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and the Metaverse, to name a few''}.\par
It's possible that for such organisations it makes better business sense to take a punt on hype bubbles like this, than to do a proper due diligence with a team of internal staff who understand their business. These endorsements should be taken with a large pinch of salt. As \href{https://newsletter.fintechtakes.com/p/metaverse-branches?s=r}{Alex Johnson says}: \textit{``At some point in the future, it’s possible that the digital worlds being built today will have aggregated sufficient user attention and engagement that financial services companies will need to invest in the metaverse as an acquisition and customer service channel. But we’re not there yet. Until the metaverse is a little less empty, resist the temptation to colonize it with branches and billboards.''}\par
Meanwhile, Meta (ex Facebook) are launching their own \href{https://archive.ph/coyp2}{META Web3 and metaverse} token (after abandoning Libre, their global cryptocurrency), and \href{https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/06/googles-cloud-group-forms-web3-product-and-engineering-team.html}{Google} have \href{https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/innovations-for-2022-at-youtube/}{recently blogged}: \textit{``Web3 also opens up new opportunities for creators. We believe new technologies like blockchain and NFTs can allow creators to build deeper relationships with their fans. Together, they'll be able to collaborate on new projects and make money in ways not previously possible. For example, giving a verifiable way for fans to own unique videos, photos, art, and even experiences from their favourite creators could be a compelling prospect for creators and their audiences. There's a lot to consider in making sure we approach these new technologies responsibly, but we think there's incredible potential as well. Finally, we couldn't have a piece about innovation without touching on the metaverse! We're thinking big about how to make viewing more immersive. ''}\par
It's already the case that the recent bubble of \href{https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/03/10/interest-in-nfts-and-the-metaverse-is-falling-fast/?}{hype is dwindling}, but the enormous investment into teams and startups will potentially bear fruit in the next couple of years, and this perhaps has implications for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). \par
In the UK the government has stated it's ambition to be a \href{https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-sets-out-plan-to-make-uk-a-global-cryptoasset-technology-hub}{global cryptoasset technology hub}, and announced plans for the Royal Mint to issue a (novelty) NFT. Like the assertion by major global businesses it is too early to tell how `sticky' these claims are.\par
With all this attention it seems timely to explore the potential of recent technologies, which can address metaverse interactions in \textit{business to business} (B2B), \textit{business to customer} (B2C), and the newer C2C (social commerce; \textit{creator to consumer, customer to customer, consumer to consumer\cite{jones2008trust})}. Figure \ref{fig:landscapevenn} demonstrates how some of these domains intersect.\par
This book seeks to overview and explain the available open source technologies. It supports an open source \href{https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse}{github repository} which enables SMEs to access these emergent platforms and ecosystems. It aims to build toward a minimum viable product for trust minimised transfer of value within a social immersive space.\par
Referencing is in two styles; academic works and books are numeric, while opinion pieces, gray statistics, and pertinent news articles are hyperlinked from the text. This hybrid style yields about twice the citation density of a normal PhD thesis, which is a lot. For this reason the normal blue hyperlink colour was eschewed in favour of a more aesthetic ``gray''. There is also a version of the PDF which complies with accessibility best practice if this is a problem.  \par 
\subsection{Notes on progress}
\textbf{This version of the book is ``minimally complete''. The real interesting work of combining the primitives into a new direction for integration of Bitcoin and VR is just beginning. We are now inviting the wider community to submit pull requests into github as contributors. It's been a useful document creation process to form our thoughts, and it's enough to bring a reader up to ``the state of the art'' if all of the thousand  links and papers are considered. It's an open ended project though.}\

\chapter{Our proposition}
This chapter identifies an intersectional space across the described technologies, and proposes a valuable and novel software stack, which can enable exploration  and product development. It is useful to briefly look at some of the potential applications which might benefit from value and trust exchange within an global shared social space.

\section{Potential applications }
\begin{itemize}
\item Art / NFT galleries with instant sales
\end{itemize}

This application allows artists and content creator communities to
display and sell NFT and fungible art to global consumer audiences,
instantly.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Large scale conference center

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Academic conferences
  \item
    Political conference
  \item
    Commercial expo
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In a hypothetical virtual conference centre a true marketplace of ideas
could be enacted, with participants being paid directly by their
audience based on the proximity to the presentation.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Group entertainment

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Global social puzzle gaming with prizes
  \item
    Music festivals and gigs - Pay live artists and DJs in real time
    depending on location within the extended landscape of the venue.
    Split to music producer a portion of the value
  \item
    Mixed reality theatre
  \item
    murder mystery
  \item
    Mixed reality live immersive MMORG games
  \item
    Bingo and mass participation gameshows
  \item
    Immersive brand storytelling metaverses
  \item
    Escape rooms
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Debating townhall meetings (with voting etc)
\item
  Mixed reality information metaverse

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    AR based city tours with collectibles
  \item
    AR based collectibles for trails and heritage (museums, libraries)
    with location specific donations.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Retail applications

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Proxy for physical market
  \item
    AR home delivery market interface within physical marketplaces
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Global course / Education provision
    \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Explore the universe as a group of spaceship or planet characters
  \item
    Explore biology and physics at a microscopic and nanoscopic level
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Micro tasking marketplace
\item
  Code bounty marketplace
\item
  Micro remittance role sharing (business PA / reception etc)
\item
  Careers fair with credential passing
\item
  Auctions in mixed reality
\item
  eSports and live sports
\item
  Gambling, betting markets, and financial leverage markets
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Global cybersec course delivery}
Isolating and building out one example here:
\begin{itemize}
\item Elements for the infrastructure: Economic layer, asset layer, content interface, user management, data storage, microsites loaded in Wolvin and webm, accessibility schema, network security, backups, secure messaging. Deployable framework with high modularity. Some more ossified elements for surity, some less so for malleability and open opportunity. Figure \ref{fig:globalclassroom}.
\item Course delivery in XR, how to we develop a platform, marketplace, framework for open contribution.
\item WebXR, Vircadia, any snap in metaverse middleware that is free and open source (action to compare the two). 
\item Define an interface schema for bolting in any commercial or FOSS metaverse engine.
\item VR marketplace (outside the scope of the VR engine) without a trusted third party.
\item Cryptographically managed learning deliverables (coursework as NFT). 
\item Secure messaging and group messaging using cryptographic keys. Check this stuff with the distributed computing science people in the group (action on John)
\item work toward an exemplar MVP which is then "in the wild"
\item Platform for educators
\item Define scheme, documentation, best practice, interfaces, functional objects, pedagogy, accessibility, multi-language. 
\item Define user management system for educators and client learners.
\item Identify the pain points which current FOSS elements which need development time/money
\item separate the UI/engine from the graphical assets, and the educational / pedagogical components, accessibility, and the value and asset transfer layers.
\item Desktop systems are the primary target (low end system)
\item define schema for accessibility. Colour, subtitles, immersion concerns which can be applied to metaverse rooms through API?
\item Start to define the hybrid presentation model we favour. Avatars? Micro sites? A combination of the two? Balance of guided vs unguided experience. Do we need to test the correct way to do delivery? Is there prior art we can draw on? I feel I should know. Is this part of the research that's being done here?
\item Big work package on schema vs key and user management to enforce rules in spaces. Only participants who have provably paid should have access to learning material, the ability to input into the assessment system, and the tokenised learning outcome `NFT' or proof.
\item Proof that XR system improve learning outcomes. Also that the proposed systems for micro-transactions and user and schema management give additional headroom for teaching.
\end{itemize}

Notes on build-out
The world database in the shared rooms in the metaverse is the global object master,  educational materials, videos,  audio content and branded objects are fungible tokens authentically proved by rgb client side validation between parties,  only validated ones will be persisted in shared rooms like conferences and classes according to the room schema. That allows educators to monetise their content.  That can work on lightning.  NFT objects between parties like content crafted by participants (coursework, homework) are not on lightning and will attract main chain fees but are rarer. User authentication and communication will be through nostr.
