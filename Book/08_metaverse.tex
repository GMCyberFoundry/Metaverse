\section{Toward an open metaverse}
For our purposes in this book and product design the interface between the previous chapter (NFTs) and this metaverse chapter is crucial. Punk6529 is a pseudonymous twitter account and thought leader in the ``crypto'' space. The text below encapsulates much of the reasoning that led to this book and product exploration, and is paraphrased \href{https://twitter.com/punk6529/status/1536046831045685248}{from this thread} for our purposes.\par
\textit{Bit by bit, the visualization layer of the internet will get better until it is unrecognisably better (+/- 10 years). As the visualization layer of the internet gets better, digital objects will become more useful and more important. Avatars (2D and 3D), art, schoolwork, work work, 3D virtual spaces and hundreds of other things. Not only will the objects themselves become more important, they will lead to different emergent behaviours. We see this already with avatars and mixed eponymous/pseudonymous/anonymous communities. Yes, it is the internet plumbing underneath, but just like social media changed human behaviour on the internet, metaverse type experiences will further change it. NFT Twitter + Discord + various virtual worlds is a form of early metaverse. I feel like I am entering a different world here, not just some websites. The most important question for the health of the internet/metaverse/human society in the 2030s will be decided now. And that question is: "who stores the definitive ownership records of those digital objects". There are two answers: a company's database OR a blockchain. If we end up with "a company's database" we will end up with all the web2 dysfunctions, but worse. SMTP is an open protocol that anyone can use so we don't have societal level fights on "who is allowed to use email". Short messaging online ended up becoming Twitter. So we end up having the most absurd, surreal discussions on the topic of "who is allowed to use short-messaging" being dependant on "who is the CEO of Twitter". There is no way this is the correct architecture for our progressively more digital economy.... If this is your first time around here, we are fighting for an open metaverse.''}\par
It seems that industry shares much of this opinion regarding an open metaverse. The proposal of a persistent interactive digital universe online is \textbf{so} vast that major players recognise that they will not be able to monopolise this space, though Facebook/Meta are clearly attempting to. The \href{https://metaverse-standards.org/news/press-releases/leading-standards-organizations-and-companies-unite-to-drive-open-metaverse-interoperability/}{Metaverse Standards Forum} is clearly an attempt by the other industry players to catch up and then get out ahead of Meta in this regard. It's also possible to view this as just another land grab, but through the vehicle of a standards body. Time will tell. They say:\par
\textit{``Announced today, The Metaverse Standards Forum brings together leading standards organizations and companies for industry-wide cooperation on interoperability standards needed to build the open metaverse. The Forum will explore where the lack of interoperability is holding back metaverse deployment and how the work of Standards Developing Organizations (SDOs) defining and evolving needed standards may be coordinated and accelerated. Open to any organization at no cost, the Forum will focus on pragmatic, action-based projects such as implementation prototyping, hackathons, plugfests, and open-source tooling to accelerate the testing and adoption of metaverse standards, while also developing consistent terminology and deployment guidelines.''}\par
This looks like it will be a useful project and community for the purposes outlined in this book, but the technology is young enough (in that it doesn't really exist) for multiple approaches to be trailed.
\subsection{Primitives}
The Metaverse Standard Forum highlights the following, which reads like the output from a brainstorm between academia and industry stakeholders.
\begin{itemize}
\item collaborative spatial computing
\item interactive 3D graphics 
\item augmented and virtual reality
\item photorealistic content authoring
\item geospatial systems
\item end-user content tooling
\item digital twins
\item real-time collaboration
\item physical simulation
\item online economies
\item multi-user gaming
\item new levels of scale and immersiveness. 
\end{itemize}
It's not a useless list by any means, but it lacks the kind of product focus we need for detailed exploration of value and trust transfer. \par
John Riccitiello, CEO of Unity Technologies says that metaverse is \textit{``The next generation of the internet that is (1) always real-time and (2) mostly 3D (3) mostly interactive, (4) mostly social and (5) mostly persistent''}. This is a useful (if still quite vague) framework. Expanding this slightly we will us the following primitives of what we think are important for a metaverse:
\begin{itemize}
\item Fusing of digital and real life
\item Social first
\item Real time interactive 3d graphics first
\item Persistent
\item Supports ownership
\item Open
\item Trusted / secure
\end{itemize} 
Added to this are externalities such as the shifting exceptions of younger demographics.
\begin{itemize}
\item Convergence of film and games
\item Blurring of IP boundaries
\item Blurring of narrative flow
\item User generated content
\item Mobile first experiences
\item Safeguarding, and governance
\end{itemize}
There is a \textbf{lot} of work for the creative and technical industries to do to integrate human narrative creativity this nascent metaverse, and it's not even completely clear that this is possible, or even what people want.
\section{History}
\textbf{This chapter is being rewritten now.} %[\href{https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jE9vLG0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works}{Rabindra+Ratan} notes to include new researchers in the lit survey].\par
The word metaverse was coined by the author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snowcrash. It started popping up soon after in \href{https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14819994-000-how-to-build-a-metaverse/}{news articles} and research papers \cite{mclellan1993avatars}, but in the last five years it has been finding a new life within a silicon valley narrative.\par
There were clear precursors to modern social VR, such as \href{https://www.howtogeek.com/778554/remembering-vrml-the-metaverse-of-1995/}{VRML in the 1990's} which laid much of the groundwork for 3D content over networked computers.\par% The author used to create commercial 3D scenes on Silicon Graphics systems back in the late 90s.\par
It might seem that there would be a clear path from there to now, in terms of a metaverse increasingly meaning connected social virtual spaces, but this has not happened. Instead interest in metaverse as a concept waned, MMORG (described later) filled in the utility, and then recently an entirely new definition emerged. The concept of the Metaverse is extremely plastic at this time (Figure \ref{fig:muskWeb3}).\par
It's arguable that what will be expanding in this chapter is more appropriately `Cyberspace' as described by William Gibson in Neuromancer \cite{gibson2019neuromancer} \textit{``A global domain within the information environment consisting of the interdependent network of information systems infrastructures including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers.''}\par
The book will aim to build toward an understanding of metaverse as a useful social mixed reality, that allows low friction communication and economic activity, within groups, at a global scale. Cryptography and distributed software can assist us with globally `true' persistence of digital data, so we will look to integrate this with our social XR.  This focus on persistence, value, and trust means it's most appropriate to focus on business uses as there is more opportunity for value creation which will be important to bootstrap this technology.\par
This chapter will first attempt to frame the context for telepresence (the academic term for communicating through technology), and then explain the increasingly polarised options for metaverse. It's useful to precisely identify the primitives of the product we would like to see here, so this chapter is far more a review of academic literature in the field, culminating in a proposed framework.\par

\section{Post `Meta' metaverse}
The current media around ``metaverse'' has been seeded by Mark Zuckerberg's rebranding of his Facebook company to `Meta', and his planned investment in the technology. In Stephenson's `Snow Crash' the Hero Protagonist (drolly called Hiro Protagonist) spends much of the novel in a dystopian virtual environment called the metaverse. It is unclear if Facebook is deliberately embracing the irony of aping such a dystopian image, but certainly their known predisposition for corporate surveillance, alongside their attempt at a global digital money is \href{https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2022/04/12/the-facebook-whistleblower-takes-on-the-metaverse-00024762}{ringing alarm bells}, as is their \href{https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/metas-new-47-5-fee-on-metaverse-items-has-nft-twitter-pissed/}{current plan} for monetisation.\par
The second order hype is likely a \href{https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/framing-the-future-of-web-3.0-metaverse-edition.html}{speculative play} by major companies on the future of the internet. Grayscale investment \href{https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grayscale_Metaverse_Report_Nov2021.pdf}{published a report} which views Metaverse as a potential trillion dollar global industry. Such industry reports are given to hyperbole, but it seems the technology is becoming the focus of technology investment narratives. Some notable exerts from a \href{https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf}{2021 report} by American bank JPMorgan show how the legacy financial institutions see this opportunity:\par
\begin{itemize}
\item In the view of the report \textit{``The metaverse is a seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives, creating a unified, virtual community where we can work, play, relax, transact, and socialize.'' - this isn't the worst definition, and very much plays into both the value and mixed reality themes explored in this book.}
\item They agree with the industry that monetisation of assets in metaverse applications is called ``Metanomics''. It's worth seeing this word once, as it's clearly gaining traction, but it won't be used in this book.
\item They make a point which is at the core of this book, that value transaction within metaverses may remove effective border controls for working globally. Be this teleoperation of robots, or shop fronts in a completely immersive VR world. They say: \textit{``One of the great possibilities of the metaverse is that it will massively expand access to the marketplace for consumers from emerging and frontier economies. The internet has already unlocked access to goods and services that were previously out of reach. Now, workers in low-income countries, for example, may be able to get jobs in western companies without having to emigrate.''}
\item There is a passage which foreshadows some of the choices made in this book: \textit{``Expanded data analytics and reporting for virtual spaces. These will be specifically designated for commercial and marketing usage and will track business key performance indicators (this
already exists in some worlds, such as Cryptovoxels)''}. More on this later.
\item The report attempts to explore the web3 \& cryptocurrency angles of metaverse. That's also the aim of this book, but they have taken a much more constrained approach, ignoring the possibilities within Bitcoin.
\item They assert that strong regulatory capture, identification, KYC/AML etc should underpin their vision of the metaverse. This is far from the community driven and organically emergent narratives that underpin Web3. This is their corporate viewpoint, something they have to say. On the back of this they pitch their consultancy services in these areas.
\end{itemize}
There has been a reactive pushback against commercialisation and corporateisation by the wider tech community, who are concerned about the aforementioned monetisation of biometrics. \href{https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/19/meta-leans-in-to-tracking-your-emotions-in-the-metaverse/}{Observers do not trust} these `Web2' players with such a potentially powerful social medium. It is very plausible that this is all just a marketing play that goes nowhere and fizzles out. It is by no means clear that people want to spend time socialising globally in virtual and mixed reality. These major companies are  making an asymmetric bet that if there is a move into virtual worlds, then they need to be stakeholders in the gatekeeping capabilities of those worlds.\section{Digital Land Metaverses}
One of the most intuitive ways to view a metaverse is as a virtual landscape. This is how metaverse was portrayed in the original Neal Stephenson use of the word. \subsection{Global enterprise perspective}
Microsoft have just bought Activision / Blizzard for around seventy billion dollars. This has been communicated by Microsoft executives as a ``Metaverse play'', leveraging their internal game item markets, and their massive multiplayer game worlds to build toward a closed metaverse experience like the one Meta is planning.
This builds on the success of early experiments like the Fornite based music concerts, which attracted millions of concurrent users to live events.
%Meta,Disney plus, Sportswear manufacturers\par

%\href{https://medium.com/kabuni/fiction-vs-non-fiction-98aa0098f3b0}{Can enough be done to prevent abuse?}
There are three emerging focuses, the social metaverses for pleasure, and business metaverses for larger group meetings and training \cite{heiphetz2010training, aldrich2005learning}, and a nascent \href{https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/01/04/omniverse-available-free-to-creators/}{collaborative creation metaverse} for digital engineers and creatives. They're all pretty different `classes' of problem. The social metaverse angle where Facebook is concentrating most effort is of less interest to us here, though obviously markets will exist in such systems for business to customer. The next section will explore some of the software tools available to connect people. Everything looks pretty basic right now in all the available systems, but that will likely \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRLnR4Kot2M}{change over the next couple of years}.
\section{NFT and crypto as metaverse}
Within the NFT, Web3 and crypto community it is normalised to refer to ownership of digital tokens as participation in a metaverse. This fusing of narratives is reviewed in detail by Gadekallu et al in their excellent recent paper on Metaverse and Blockchain \cite{gadekallu2022blockchain}. They conclude that much remains to be done here. This CNBC article highlights the confusion, as this major news outlet refers to \href{https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html}{Walmart prepares to offer NFTs}'' as an entry ``into the metaverse''.
\section{Immersive and third person XR}
In considering the needs of business to business and business to client social VR is it useful to compare software platforms. We have seen that a global connected multiverse is a marketing proposition only, and may be a decade or more away. Contenders currently look more like one of three catagories; games, limited massively multiplayer worlds, or meeting support software. These will converge.
\subsection{More like a metaverse}
\subsubsection{Second Life}
Notable because it's the original and has a decently mature marketplace. Some \$80M was \href{https://www.zdnet.com/article/high-fidelity-invests-in-second-life-to-expand-virtual-world/}{paid to creators} in Second Life in 2021 in a wider economic ecosystem of around \$650M. It's possible to write a whole book on Second life, and indeed many have. It's longevity means that there's more study of business uses of such systems than in any other platform. 
\subsubsection{Mozilla Hubs}
Hubs is a great option for this proposal, and might be worth integrating later. It runs well in a browser and on VR hardware.
\begin{itemize}
\item Open source, bigger scale, more complex
\item Choose avatars, or import your own
\item Environments are provided, or can be designed
\item Useful for larger conferences with hundreds or thousands of members but is commensurately more complex
\item Quest and PC
\item Larger scenes within scenes
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Counter social realms}
A relatively new platform linked to a new model of social media which excludes countries which habitually spam. It uses Mozilla Hubs for it's engine.
\subsubsection{Roblox}
If anything can currently claim to be the metaverse it's probably Roblox. Around 60 billion messages are \href{https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/developments-investments-experiences-in-the-metaverse/id1593908027?i=1000540906629}{sent daily} in Roblox. Investment in the metaverse `angle' of the platform is stepping up with recent announcements such as \href{https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/spotify-becomes-first-music-streamer-to-launch-on-roblox/?}{``Spotify Island''}. It's very notable that it still \href{https://fortune.com/2022/06/03/roblox-gaming-ecosystem-metaverse-stocks-profit/}{hasn't become a profitable business}.
\subsubsection{Surreal}
\subsubsection{Sansar}
\subsubsection{Cornerstone}
\subsubsection{AltSpace}
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft social meeting platform
\item Very good custom avatar design
\item Great world building editor in the engine
\item Doesn't really support business integration so it's a bit out of scope
\item Huge numbers (many thousands) possible so it's great for global events
\item Mac support
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{VRChat}
This text is from wikipedia and will be updated when we have a chance to try VRChat properly. It's much loved already by the Bitcoin community.\par
``VRChat's gameplay is similar to that of games such as Second Life and Habbo Hotel. Players can create their own instanced worlds in which they can interact with each other through virtual avatars. A software development kit for Unity released alongside the game gives players the ability to create or import character models to be used in the platform, as well as build their own worlds.\par
Player models are capable of supporting "audio lip sync, eye tracking and blinking, and complete range of motion.\par
VRChat is also capable of running in "desktop mode" without a VR headset, which is controlled using either a mouse and keyboard, or a gamepad. Some content has limitations in desktop mode, such as the inability to freely move an avatar's limbs, or perform interactions that require more than one hand.\par
In 2020, a new visual programming language was introduced known as "Udon", which uses a node graph system. While still considered alpha software, it became usable on publicly-accessible worlds beginning in April 2020. A third-party compiler known as "UdonSharp" was developed to allow world scripts to be written in C sharp.'' 
\subsubsection{Meta Horizon Worlds \& Workrooms}
Horizon Worlds is the Meta (Facebook) meteverse, and Workrooms it's business offering and a subset of the ``Worlds'' global system. It is currently a walled garden without connection to the outside digital world, and arguably not therefore a metaverse.\par
The Financial Times \href{}{took a look} at their patent applications and noted that the travel is toward increased user behaviour tracking, and targeted advertising.\par
Facebook actually have a poor history on innovation and diversification of their business model. This model has previously been tracking users to target ads on their platform, while increasing and maintaining attention using machine learning algorithms. \par
It makes complete sense then to analyse the move by Meta into 3D social spaces as an attempt to front run the technology using their huge investment capacity. Facebook have recently taken a huge hit to their share price. Nothing seems to have changed in the underling business except Zuckerberg's well publicised shift to supporting a money losing gamble on the Metaverse. It is by no means clear that users want this, that Meta will be able to better target ads on this new platform, or that the markets are willing to trust Zuckerburg on this proactive move. \par
With all this said the investment and management capacity and capability at Meta cannot be dismissed. It is very likely that Meta will be able to rapidly deploy a 3D social space, and that it's development will continue to be strong for years. The main interface for Horizon Worlds is through the Meta owned and developer Oculus headset, which is excellent and reasonably affordable. It has been quite poorly received \href{https://kotaku.com/facebook-metaverse-horizon-worlds-vr-oculus-quest-2-cha-1848436740}{by reviewers} but will likely improve, especially if users are encouraged to innovate.
\subsubsection{Webaverse}
\href{https://webaverse.com/}{Webaverse} are an open collective using open source tools to create interoperable metaverses.
\subsubsection{Vircadia}
\input{08_vircadia}
\subsection{More like crypto NFT virtual land}
This next three are a placeholder taking text from the \href{https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-metaverse-platforms-that-will-replace-social-media-in-future/}{linked site} and will be swapped out:
\subsubsection{Decentraland}
Decentraland is the first-ever blockchain-powered place in the metaverse. It is a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications.
\subsubsection{Sandbox}
The Sandbox is a virtual Metaverse where players can play, build, own, and monetize their virtual experiences. The Sandbox blockchain gaming platform consists of three integrated products that together provide a comprehensive experience for user-generated content.
\subsubsection{Space Somnium}  
Somnium Space is a metaverse with a different objective. It allows users to join in either through a downloadable VR client or a browser-based version to function like any other web app.
\subsection{More like meeting support}
\subsubsection{Spatial}
Spatial is worth a quick look because it's a business first meeting tool, and comparatively well received by industry for that purpose.
\begin{itemize}
\item Very compelling. Wins at wow.
\item Great avatars, user generated
\item AR first design
\item Limited scenes
\item Smaller groups (12?)
\item Limited headset support
\item Intuitive meeting support tools
\item No back end integration
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{MeetinVR}
\begin{itemize}
\item Good enough graphics, pretty mature system
\item OK indicative avatars, user selected
\item VR first design
\item Limited scenes
\item Smaller groups (12?)
\item Quest and PC
\item Writing and gestures supported
\item Some basic enterprise tools integration
\item Bring in 3D objects
\item Need to apply for a license?
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Glue}
\begin{itemize}
\item Better enterprise security integration
\item Larger environments, potential for breakouts in the same space. Workshop capable
\item 3D object support, screen sharing, some collaborative tools
\item Apply for a license
\item Fairly basic graphics
\item Basic avatars
\item Quest and PC
\item Writing and gestures supported
\item Mac support
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{FramesVR}
\begin{itemize}
\item Really simple to join
\item Basic avatars
\item Bit buggy
\item 3D object support, screen sharing, some collaborative tools
\item Quest and PC
\item Larger scenes within scenes
\item Runs in the browser
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Engage}
\begin{itemize}
\item Great polished graphics
\item Fully customisable avatars
\item Limited scenes
\item Presentation to groups for education and learning
\item PC first, quest is side loadable but that's a technical issue
\item BigScreen VR
\item Seated in observation points in a defined shared theatre
\item Screen sharing virtual communal screen watching, aimed at gamers, film watching
\item up to 12 user
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Gather}
Gather is an oddball meeting space based around fully customisable 2D rooms with a game feel. It's really a spatialised twist on video conferencing but interesting.  
\subsubsection{NEOSVR}
\href{https://neos.com/}{Notable because} it's trying to integrate crypto marketplaces, but we haven't tried it yet.
\section{The future}
\subsection{Augmented reality}
Marc Petit, general manager of Epic Games envisages a 2 watt pair of glasses, connected to a 10 watt phone, connected to a 100 watt computer on the edge. This is a device cascade problem which has not yet been solved, and is at the edge of achievable thermodynamics and latency.\par
The closest technology at this time seems to be \href{https://lumusvision.com/}{Lumus' waveguide projectors} which are light, bright and high resolution. 
\subsection{Ubiquitous displays}
\section{Risks}
Metaverse is fraught with risks, partly because it's new, and partly because of the pace of adoption.
\begin{itemize}
\item Abuse; because of the real-time and spatio-temporal abuse happens less like in the current web 2 social media, and more like in the real world, but with less opportunity for repercussions. It might be that natural language processing and machine learning can help with this, but it's a tough problem. One idea might be to record the speech to text of interactions between participants, and flag to them if a ``bullying, harassment, predation threshold'' is met. This could be encrypted with the public keys of the participants and a notice sent to them that if they wished to follow up with authorities then they have the necessary attestations and proofs. This is minimally invasive and privacy preserving, and acts as a strong disincentive to repeat offence. It can also feed into a global ``web of trust'' reputation system in a `zero knowledge' way. Users who flag abuse to the reputation system can leverage the machine learning opinion without revealing what happened (though they would have the data). This would also act as a disincentive without the social stigma issues of reporting.\par
Reporting could be achieved without machine learning identification of potential problems, but there would have to be a social cost to reporting (like gossiping incessantly about others) which would erode the social score of the reporting entity. This would mitigate bot based reputation harm.
\item Miscommunication; which as we have seen in the early section of the metaverse chapter is both complex and hard to mitigate
\item Lost information
\item Distraction
\item Jitter, judder, jagginess, and interruption of flow; because the network overhead is higher than other communication media it's much more exposed to latency effects 
\item Physical harms, especially to developing brains and ocular systems
\end{itemize}
