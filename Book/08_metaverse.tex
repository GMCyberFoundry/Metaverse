The word metaverse was coined by the author Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel Snowcrash. It started popping up soon after in \href{https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14819994-000-how-to-build-a-metaverse/}{news articles} and research papers \cite{mclellan1993avatars}, but in the last five years it has been finding a new life within a silicon valley narrative.\par
There were clear precursors to modern social VR, such as \href{https://www.howtogeek.com/778554/remembering-vrml-the-metaverse-of-1995/}{VRML in the 1990's} which laid much of the groundwork for 3D content over networked computers.\par% The author used to create commercial 3D scenes on Silicon Graphics systems back in the late 90s.\par
It might seem that there would be a clear path from there to now, in terms of a metaverse increasingly meaning connected social virtual spaces, but this has not happened. Instead interest in metaverse as a concept waned, MMORG (described later) filled in the utility, and then recently an entirely new definition emerged. The concept of the Metaverse is extremely plastic at this time (Figure \ref{fig:muskWeb3}). This book will aim to build toward an understanding of metaverse which really means a useful social mixed reality layer, that allows low friction communication and economic activity, within groups, at a global scale. This focus on value and trust means it's most appropriate to focus on business uses.\par
This chapter will attempt to frame the context for telepresence (the academic term for communicating through technology), and then explain the increasingly polarised options for metaverse. It's useful to precisely identify the primitives of the product we would like to see here, so this chapter is far more a review of academic literature in the field, culminating in a proposed framework.\par

\section{Post `Meta' metaverse}
The current media around ``metaverse'' has been seeded by Mark Zuckerberg's rebranding of his Facebook company to `Meta', and his planned investment in the technology. In Stephenson's `Snow Crash' the Hero Protagonist (drolly called Hiro Protagonist) spends much of the novel in a dystopian virtual environment called the metaverse. It is unclear if Facebook is deliberately embracing the irony of aping such a dystopian image, but certainly their known predisposition for corporate surveillance, alongside their attempt at a global digital money is ringing alarm bells.\par
The second order hype is likely a \href{https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/pages/framing-the-future-of-web-3.0-metaverse-edition.html}{speculative play} by major companies on the future of the internet. Grayscale investment \href{https://grayscale.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Grayscale_Metaverse_Report_Nov2021.pdf}{published a report} which views Metaverse as a potential trillion dollar global industry. Such industry reports are given to hyperbole, but it seems the technology is becoming the focus of technology investment narratives. Some notable exerts from a \href{https://www.jpmorgan.com/content/dam/jpm/treasury-services/documents/opportunities-in-the-metaverse.pdf}{2021 report} by American bank JPMorgan show how the legacy financial institutions see this opportunity:\par
\begin{itemize}
\item In the view of the report \textit{``The metaverse is a seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives, creating a unified, virtual community where we can work, play, relax, transact, and socialize.'' - this isn't the worst definition, and very much plays into both the value and mixed reality themes explored in this book.}
\item They agree with the industry that monetisation of assets in metaverse applications is called ``Metanomics''. It's worth seeing this word once, as it's clearly gaining traction, but it won't be used in this book.
\item They make a point which is at the core of this book, that value transaction within metaverses may remove effective border controls for working globally. Be this teleoperation of robots, or shop fronts in a completely immersive VR world. They say: \textit{``One of the great possibilities of the metaverse is that it will massively expand access to the marketplace for consumers from emerging and frontier economies. The internet has already unlocked access to goods and services that were previously out of reach. Now, workers in low-income countries, for example, may be able to get jobs in western companies without having to emigrate.''}
\item There is a passage which foreshadows some of the choices made in this book: \textit{``Expanded data analytics and reporting for virtual spaces. These will be specifically designated for commercial and marketing usage and will track business key performance indicators (this
already exists in some worlds, such as Cryptovoxels)''}. More on this later.
\item The report attempts to explore the web3 \& cryptocurrency angles of metaverse. That's also the aim of this book, but they have taken a much more constrained approach, ignoring the possibilities within Bitcoin.
\item They assert that strong regulatory capture, identification, KYC/AML etc should underpin their vision of the metaverse. This is far from the community driven and organically emergent narratives that underpin Web3. This is their corporate viewpoint, something they have to say. On the back of this they pitch their consultancy services in these areas.
\end{itemize}

There has been a reactive pushback against commercialisation and corporateisation by the wider tech community, who are concerned about the aforementioned monetisation of biometrics. \href{https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/01/19/meta-leans-in-to-tracking-your-emotions-in-the-metaverse/}{Observers do not trust} these `Web2' players with such a potentially powerful social medium. It is very plausible that this is all just a marketing play that goes nowhere and fizzles out. It is by no means clear that people want to spend time socialising globally in virtual and mixed reality. These major companies are  making an asymmetric bet that if there is a move into virtual worlds, then they need to be stakeholders in the gatekeeping capabilities of those worlds.\par

\section{Immersive and third person XR}
In considering the needs of business to business and business to client social VR is it useful to compare software platforms:
\subsubsection{Second Life}
Notable because it's the original and has a decently mature marketplace. Some \$80B was \href{https://www.zdnet.com/article/high-fidelity-invests-in-second-life-to-expand-virtual-world/}{paid to creators} in Second Life in 2021 in a wider economic ecosystem of around \$650M.
\subsubsection{Roblox}
Around 60 billion messages are \href{https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/developments-investments-experiences-in-the-metaverse/id1593908027?i=1000540906629}{sent daily} in Roblox

\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{VRChat}

\subsubsection{NEOSVR}
\href{https://neos.com/}{Notable because} it's trying to integrate crypto marketplaces
\subsubsection{Meta Horizon Worlds \& Workrooms}
Horizon Worlds is the Meta (Facebook) meteverse, and Workrooms it's business offering and a subset of the ``Worlds'' global system. It is currently a walled garden without connection to the outside digital world, and arguably not therefore a metaverse.\par
The Financial Times \href{}{took a look} at their patent applications and noted that the travel is toward increased user behaviour tracking, and targeted advertising.\par
Facebook actually have a poor history on innovation and diversification of their business model. This model has previously been tracking users to target ads on their platform, while increasing and maintaining attention using machine learning algorithms. \par
It makes complete sense then to analyse the move by Meta into 3D social spaces as an attempt to front run the technology using their huge investment capacity. Facebook have recently taken a huge hit to their share price. Nothing seems to changed in the underling business except Zuckerbergs well publicised shift to supporting a money losing gamble on the Metaverse. It is by no means clear that users want this, that Meta will be able to better target ads on this new platform, or that the markets are willing to trust Zuckerburg on this proactive move. \par
With all this said the investment and management capacity and capability at Meta cannot be dismissed. It is very likely that Meta will be able to rapidly deploy a 3D social space, and that it's development will continue to be strong for years. The main interface for Horizon Worlds is through the Meta owned and developer Oculus headset, which is excellent and reasonably affordable. It has been quite poorly received \href{https://kotaku.com/facebook-metaverse-horizon-worlds-vr-oculus-quest-2-cha-1848436740}{by reviewers} but will likely improve, especially if users are encouraged to innovate.
\subsubsection{Webaverse}
\href{https://webaverse.com/}{Webaverse} are an open collective using open source tools to create interoperable metaverses.
