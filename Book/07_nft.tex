Nonfungible tokens are a whole `class' of digital token, separate and distinct from everything discussed to this point. They are generally \href{https://www.signaturelitigation.com/nfts-recognised-as-property-lavinia-deborah-osbourne-v-1-persons-unknown-2-ozone-networks-inc-trading-as-opensea/}{recognised in law} as property in their own right \cite{moringiello2021property, fairfield2021tokenized}. In the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) and project tokens detailed earlier, and limiting this description of the Ethereum network for now, a project launching an ERC-20 token commits contract code to the blockchain, and this contract then mediates the issuance and management of million or billions of tokens associated with that project, and it's use case. \href{https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/}{ERC-20} is a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility}{fungible} token issuance. Each of the projects' tokens is interchangeable with any other token. They're all the same from the point of view of the user.\par
Rather than the ERC-20 contract type used for fungible token issuance NTFs predominantly use ERC-721 on Ethereum. It's the case that most NFTs in the current hype bubble are algorithmically generated sets of themed art (so called PFP-NFT). Tens of thousands of distinct tokens are `minted', each one being a complex transaction commitment to the Ethereum blockchain, along with it's associated gas fee. These minting events are much hyped social occasions, and happen very quickly, with users clamouring to create art with randomly allocated features from the art schema associated with the project. Lucky winners can find themselves with an NFT art piece with more than an average number of `rare' features. If the overall mint becomes more popular, then the secondary market for all of those mints goes up, and because of the liquidity premium they can go up a lot. The perceived rarer mints go up a lot more. This whole process is \href{https://memoakten.medium.com/the-unreasonable-ecological-cost-of-cryptoart-2221d3eb2053}{very energy intensive} on the chain, and the vast majority of these project simply \href{https://www.turing.ac.uk/blog/non-fungible-tokens-can-we-predict-price-theyll-sell}{trend to zero value}. \par
In response to this appalling cost benefit analysis the Ethereum foundation have proposed \href{https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2309}{EIP-2309} to make minting NFTs more efficient. They say ``This standard lets you mint as many as you like in one transaction!''\par
The Ethereum foundation give their somewhat constrained view of \href{https://ethereum.org/en/nft/}{NFTs on their website} and it's a useful primer. On that page they detail some of the use cases, as listed below with a critique added:
\begin{itemize}
\item Digital content; this is the dominant use case right now. Much more on this later.
\item Gaming items; again more on this later, it's an obvious enough use case but \href{https://climatereplay.org/nfts/nft-digital-ownership-pledge/}{complex politics} in the intersection of games and crypto have stalled the adoption curve
\item Domain names; this is just starting to reach for applications now, why not a database with the ISP/host?
\item Physical items; this is a clear over-reach as transfer of the NFT does not imply tranfer of the object.
\item Investments and collateral; while this is indeed an emergent option in the tech right now it's likely just a bubble, as owners of the tokens cast around for additional liquidity, and loan businesses chase yield with higher risk.
\end{itemize}
Moving away from Ethereum, NFTs can be minted on most of the other level one chains. Solana is a great newcomer example. Sol is a terrible chain with regards to decentralisation, but thanks to that it's far cheaper and faster to mint NFTs on it, and it's become a \href{https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-eth-killers-nfts-defi-solana-cardano-wax-crypto-investing-2022-1}{troubling competitor} for Eth (Figure \ref{fig:solnfts}).\par 
\begin{figure*}[ht]\centering % Using \begin{figure*} makes the figure take up the entire width of the page

	\caption{Solana NFT markets are enjoying growth compared to Opensea on Ethereum, even in the downturn.}
	\label{fig:solnfts}
\end{figure*}
The same might be true for Cardano's ADA, though ADA is struggling to hold onto it's market position despite some technical advances. It's worth reiterating here that the nature of these digital tools likely makes for a `winner take all' market dynamic over time. With fees being central to this generative NFT use case it's possible to see that highly centralised, fast, and cheap chains will capture and eventually dominate the space. Remember that this likely game theoretic outcome is a huge cognitive dissonance as this might as well be a database running without the stark inefficiencies of blockchain. The whole NFT space is a gamble on consumer enthusiasm for spending money continuing to outpace logic.\par 
Astonishingly, according to a JPMorgan insider market report (\href{https://www.coindesk.com/podcasts/the-breakdown-with-nlw/jpmorgan-bitcoin-shows-some-merit-as-a-store-of-value/}{reported on in a podcast}), only around 2 million people have ever actually interacted with NFTs. This is far below what one might expect given the hype.\par
With that said NFTs have clearly allowed \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_non-fungible_tokens}{digital and new media artists} to connect with audiences without gatekeepers. Established mediators and curators of art have been caught totally wrongfooted, and NFTs seem to give a way for them to be cut out completely. There are suggestions of applications beyond this initial digital art scope. This is a compounding, and disrupting paradigm change.\par
%Users of NFT markets have \href{https://blog.chainalysis.com/reports/nft-market-report-preview-2021/}{injected around \$30 billion into the tokens during 2021}. 
While it is likely that this is currently a speculative bubble, that is \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61102759}{waning already}, it seems certain that the technology is here to stay in some form.\par
%Samsung for instance have announced that their TVs will support not only \href{https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-2022-micro-led-neo-qled-lifestyle-tvs-personalization-options-ces-2022/}{display of NFTs} with artist defined settings in the metadata, but also an integrated marketplace for browsing and purchasing.\par
One of the most interesting companies is Yuga Labs, who launched the incredibly popular Bored Ape Yacht club set of 10,000 algorithmically generated NFTs. These Ethereum based NFTs were based loosely on the `Crypto Punks' model of PFP-NFT (variously profile picture project, picture for proof, and picture for profile - no definition remains uncontested for long). Yuga launched with a better commercialisation model for the holders, and a strong marketing drive into celebrity circles. They now regularly change hands for hundreds of thousands of pounds.\par
Yuga recently bought the artistic rights to the commercial reuse of similarly popular (and preceding) Punks set. This is interesting because they have again handed the commercial re-use rights to the owners of the individual NFTs. This raises the same \href{https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-21/bored-ape-nft-spinoff-venture-gone-sour-sparks-legal-fight}{confusing problem} with attaching commercial rights to an easily stolen token as NFTs for real estate does. This has been demonstrated recently when Seth Green had a Bored Ape stolen after \href{https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/seth-green-bored-ape-stolen-tv-show}{creating an animated show around it's IP}.  \par
The community around these collections is incredibly strong, mixing developers, artists, the rich and famous, and the fortunate and early, into a cohesive community who communicate online. The developer `good will' is enormous, and it seems possible that this will lead to faster and broader innovation around the collections, and out into \href{https://twitter.com/yugalabs/status/1505014986556551172?}{metaverse applications}. The brand is strong, and the individual NFT items both benefit from, and reinforce that brand, while adding personal narratives and human interest.\par 
As a gauge of how frothy this market still is it's interesting to look at the APE token which Yuga just launched. They airdropped 10,000 of the tokens free to each of the 10,000 NFT holders. This instantly created a multi-billion dollar market cap, and a top 50 `crypto' out of thin air, based purely on their brand. It's clear that there is both brand, and a market here.\par
A recent report from "Base Layer" tries to capture the community `feature' of big brand NFTs. \href{https://baselayer.so/crypto-culture-decoded}{``Crypto culture decoded''} explains that is is these online communities which are the attraction not necessarily the art. This is a powerful `in group' argument, though speculation remains the most likely underpinning.

\section{MMORG games and NFTs}
Traditional gamers have pushed back on the seemingly useful idea of integrating NTFs with traditional games. This may be in part because Ethereum mining has kept graphics card prices high for a decade.

\href{https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hbar-foundation-and-ubisoft-partner-to-support-growth-of-gaming-on-hedera-network-301474971.html}{HBAR partnerships}\par
\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/news/epic-games-vp-people-have-lost-interest-in-the-metaverse-200725562.html}{Critique from Marc Petit of Epic and Unreal}.\par
The \href{https://twitter.com/justinkan/status/1491270239967154178}{following text} is from Justin Kan, co-founder of twitch: \textit{``NFTs are a better business model for games. Many gamers seem to be raging hard against game studios selling NFTs. But NFTs are also better for players. Here’s why I think blockchain games will be the predominant business model in gaming in ten years. NFTs are a better business model for funding games . Example: recently I invested in a new web3 game SynCityHQ. They are building a mafia metaverse and raised \$3M in their initial NFT drop.\\ NFTs give studios access to a new capital market for raising capital from the crowd.NFTs can be a better ongoing model for games. Web3 games will open economies, and by building the games on open and programmable assets (tokens + NFTs) they will create far more economic value than they could from any one game. Imagine Fortnite, but other developers can build experiences on top of the V-Bucks and skins. Epic would get a royalty every time any transaction happens. As big as Fortnite is today, Open Fortnite could be much bigger, because it will be a true platform. NFTs are better for gamers Allowing gamers to have ownership of the assets they buy and earn in game allows them to participate in the potential growth of a game. It lets gamers preserve some economic value when they switch to playing something new. But what about the criticisms of NFTs?\\
Here are my thoughts on the common FUDs: "It’s just a money grab on the part of the studios!"\\
Game studios already switched over to the model of selling in-game items, cosmetics, etc to players long ago. But currently the digital stuff players are buying isn’t re-sellable. NFT ownership is strictly better for players. "The games aren’t real games." This reminds me of the criticism of free-to-play in 2008, when the games were Mafia Wars / FarmVille. We haven’t had time for great developers to create incredible experiences yet. Everyone investing in games knows there are great teams building. "Game NFTs aren’t really decentralized because they rely on models / assets inside centralized game clients."
Crypto is as much a movement as it is a technology. Putting items on a blockchain is what gives people trust that they have participatory ownership...which make people willing to buy in to the game. These assets are “backed” by blockchain.
The fact that these item collections are NFTs will make other people willing to build on top of them. "NFTs are bad for the environment." Solana and L2s solve this. NFT games are better for players and for game developers. Like the free-to-play revolution changed gaming, so will blockchain. The games of the future will be fully robust, with open and programmable economies.}''


\section{Other uses}
So far according to a16z NFTs break down into:
\begin{itemize}
\item Profile pictures: These were discussed at the start of the chapter and have felt ubiquitous on Twitter over the last couple of years. The major projects will likely hold value, but the hype cycle will likely lead to all profile NFTs going in and out of fashion.
\item Art and Music: Art has also been discussed above. Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who founded PayPal has invested in expanded NTF use cases. The first is `Royal' which is experimentally \href{https://royal.io/}{selling limited NFT tokens} which contractually entitle the holder to a portion of music artist royalties. Spotify are experimenting with music NFTs. This is an early adopter area.
\item Gaming: As discussed there's pushback from the gaming community, but huge investment from the likes of Lego, Blizzard, Epic, Ubisoft etc.
\item Gig tickets: Not only the straightforward use of transferable tickets for events as NFTs on a blockchain (which is impossible due to the cost right now) but also onward monetisation of ticket stubs as memorabilia. The NBA is \href{https://deadspin.com/investing-in-nft-ticket-stubs-is-likely-one-of-the-nba-1848991991}{already looking at this}.\\
\textit{``The team sells the ticket for face value many many years ago, but when that stub is being sold now for much more many times over, the team gets none of that money,'' York explained. ``But with an NFT stub that changes. Let’s say a new rookie enters the NBA next season and he turns out to be the next LeBron James. That ticket stub from his first game, as an NFT, the team can put a commission on it — 20 percent or however much, the NBA decides that. In 10 years when it’s worth a lot of money, I or whoever owns that NFT, can sell it for say \$100,000. The NBA can still collect 20 percent of that sale, because it’s all on a smart contract.''}
\item Utility: These are broadly `membership' style tokens, and this seems like a sensible fit. Peter Thiel (again) for instance launches a \href{https://www.ztonft.com/}{political funding NFT} from Blake Masters to support his senate ambitions. To be clear, Thiel is a fundamentalist libertarian, and at the very least \href{https://gizmodo.com/peter-thiel-bitcoin-talk-miami-2022-1848764790}{highly eccentric}. This is not necessarily a positive for the technology.
\item Virtual worlds are a huge application for NFTs, and this seems like it would be a natural fit for out metaverse application. In reality the \$2B of sold so far is mostly `allocations' in nascent ecosystems, being sold as highly speculative assets, without even a metaverse to use. The majority of that amount is the hyped `Otherland' plots sold under the Bored Apes brand.
\end{itemize}
It is completely reasonable to assert that these use cases could be accomplished without the use of NFT technology, and is part of the hype bubble.\par
NFT art currently suffers from the same failure of decentralisation already discussed in the Ethererum technology stack, but this is compounded by the normalisation of intermediate art brokers \href{https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html}{continuing to custody} the NFTs even after sale. They are usually selling a pointer to their own servers. The market is nascent and evolving, but it's currently not delivering on it's core promise.\par
Proof of ownership is intuitively a pretty obvious application for the technology, but again it's hard to justify the expense when the benefits are so slim. \href{https://www.bullishlybred.com/}{Bulldogs on the blockchain} is a clear gimmick, and might even incentivise poor behaviours as there are two products here which are not necessarily aligned. Much has been written over the years about \href{https://propy.com/browse/propy-nft/}{deeds to property} being passed through blockchains, cutting out the middle man, but in the event that a house deed NFT was hacked and stolen it's obviously not the case that the property would then pass to the hacker.

\section{Objects in our metaverse}
NFTs seem to be judged crucial to metaverse applications. Meta (ex Facebook) are hanging their monetisation of their whole rebrand on taking a huge cut from NFT content creators on their platform.\par
We have a path to assets and NFTs within the layer 3 elements of our choices (RGB), but they're not yet fit for purpose. There are compromise options already available, as below.
\subsection{Liquid tokens}
We have seen that Liquid from Blockstream is a comparatively mature and battle tested sidechain framework, based upon Bitcoin. It is possible to issue tokens on Liquid, and these have their own hardware wallet available. This makes the technology a strong contender for our uses.
\subsection{Sovryn and RSK}
It's slightly unclear when RSK will support assets at this level. This needs to be revisited.
\subsubsection{Optimistic rollups}
\lipsum[50]
\subsubsection{Zero Knowledge rollups}
\lipsum[50]
\subsection{Stacks and STX}
There's another possible option is Stacks, without the network effect of Ethereum, but closer to the other design choices made so far. ``Stacks is an open-source network of decentralized apps and smart contracts built on Bitcoin.''\\ 
This novel approach saw the launch of a layer 1 blockchain token called STX, which is used in a similar way to gas in Ethereum. but claims settlement on the Bitcoin network. This is achieved through a novel bridging approach which they call Proof of Transfer (PoX).\\
Stacks users say this hybrid approach is a pragmatic solution which enables dApps, smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs etc without compromising security. In practice the speculative component of the STX tokens which underpin these operations clouds the issue somewhat. It is a potentially useful middle ground solution with a great deal of developer attention.
\subsection{Ethereum}
While it's been discounted elsewhere it's hard to ignore the network effect of Eth NFTs. If the aspiration is to attract the bulk of the `legacy' creator/consumer markets then it will be necessary to support integration of Metamask into any FOSS stack. This isn't a huge technical challenge, nor is it particularly of interest to our use cases at this stage, but it remains a possibility. The main problems remain the slow speed and high expense of the system.
\subsection{Solana}
Solana is both cheap and fast, because it's very highly centralised. It seems unlikely that it's worth this level of compromise.
\subsection{Satoshi Ordinals}
Satoshi ordinals \href{https://github.com/casey/ord}{allow tracking of Sats across transactions}, enabling NFT like assignment tracking. This is a hugely exciting development but extremely early.
\subsection{FROST on Bitcoin}
It \textbf{might} be possible to transfer ownership of a UTXO on the Bitcoin base chain using FROST \cite{komlo2020frost}. In this Schnorr \& Taproot based threshold signature system it's possible to \href{https://btctranscripts.com/sydney-bitcoin-meetup/2022-03-29-socratic-seminar/}{add and remove signatories} and thresholds of signing without touching the UTXO itself. In principle (though not yet in practice) this might allow transfer of UTXO ownership. 
\subsection{Spacechains}
It feels like spacechains are almost ready, so this is worth keeping an eye on. It's the `cleanest' way to issue assets using Bitcoin because there's no additional speculative chain. As briefly explained in the earlier section Bitcoin is destroyed to create a new chain which then inherits the security of Bitcoin through onward mining. This new asset or chain is able to accrue value and trade independently based purely on it's value to the buyer, not as a function of a wider speculative bubble attached to a token with multiple use cases.
