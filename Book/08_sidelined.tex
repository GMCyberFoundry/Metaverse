\section{Digital Land Metaverses}
One of the most intuitive ways to view a metaverse is as a virtual landscape. This is how metaverse was portrayed in the original Neal Stephenson use of the word. 


\section{NFT as metaverse narrative}
Within the NFT community it is normalised to refer to ownership of digital tokens as participation in a metaverse. 
This CNBC article highlights the confusion, as this major news outlet refers to \href{https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html}{Walmart prepares to offer NFTs}'' as an entry ``into the metaverse''.

\begin{itemize}
\item As a user I want to select a digital asset I find in the AR/VR world and then be offered an option to purchase the asset so I can look at it in my own spaces.
\item As a user I want to click on a digital asset I find in the AR app and be given the opportunity to buy it as a rare digital representation so that only I and a few others are provably certified to own.
\item As a user I would like to transfer economic value to people and entities I meet in the metaverse such that it is agreed by all parties quickly that value has been provably transferred.
\item As a user I would like to access an online marketplace in the metaverse where I swap and trade digital assets with other users so that I continue to feel engaged.
\item As a user I would like to create content (inside or outside of the metaverse) so I can take it to metaverse and monetise it.
\item As a content creator or influencer I would like to engage with live audiences within the metaverse, and moneytise my opinions and knowledge in real-time. I would like to have a way to split this money with co-collaborators in real time.
\end{itemize}

Probably the best example in the market at this time with connecting users with one another through blockchain is \href{https://lightnite.io/}{Satoshis Games `Litenite'}. Litenite is a `battle royale' game which allows users to earn Satoshis through the Lightning network.\par
Similarly, and potentially more significantly, \href{https://twitter.com/zebedeeio/status/1512128093653196809}{Zebedee} have brought Lightning based micropayments to \href{https://zebedee.io/infuse/}{Counter Strike}, which adds a financial layer directly to eSport, itself a multi billion pound global industry.\par
The Zebedee model is interesting in that they provide simple onboarding, and management solutions, for gaming and metaverse application developers. There is doubtless an opportunity to utilise their business model in the proposed stacks in the paper, but it would be at odds with the free and open source product methodology in this paper. Their CTO said the following in a \href{https://lightningjunkies.net/lightning-address-making-lightning-user-friendly-lnj052/}{recent podcast}:\par
``We all had very similar ideas around being able to put Lightning network capabilities into games. You're essentially putting real value inside of the game. So whether it's a point inside of the game or as a real end game economy, as a game developer, you don't have to worry about the mechanics around it.\par
You can use a real life currency: the money that exists in the world and that value carries regardless of which game you're in, regardless if you're in the real world or inside of a virtual world, like a game. We just think that vision is just sort of opening. Now there's so much more, if you extrapolate it into the Meatverse we would love for Zebedee to be a big platform provider and enabler for a lot of these.''\par
\href{https://spellsofgenesis.com/}{Spells of Genesis} is a long running card RPG trading game on mobiles which allows ``ownership'' of items and cards through non-fungible token ecosystems.\par
There are also hundreds of casinos which operate within and even on blockchain networks. These feel out of scope as they are a different and somewhat regulated offering.
