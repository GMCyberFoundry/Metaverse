  abstract = {Purpose-- The purpose of this study is to propose a taxonomy of meeting
	purpose. Meetings are a workplace activity that deserves increased
	attention from researchers and practitioners. Previous researchers
	attempted to develop typologies of meeting purpose with limited success.
	Through a comparison of classification methodologies, the authors
	consider a taxonomy as the appropriate classification scheme for
	meeting purpose. The authors then utilize the developed taxonomy
	to investigate the frequency with which a representative sample of
	working adults engaged in meetings of these varying purposes. Their
	proposed taxonomy provides relevant classifications for future research
	on meetings as well and serves as a useful tool for managers seeking
	to use and evaluate the effectiveness of meetings within their organizations.
	Design/methodology/approach-- This study employs an inductive methodology
	using discourse analysis of qualitative meeting descriptions to develop
	a taxonomy of meeting purpose. The authors discourse analysis utilizes
	open-ended survey responses from a sample of working adults (n =
	491). Findings-- The authors categorical analysis of open-ended questions
	resulted in a 16-category taxonomy of meeting purpose. The two most
	prevalent meeting purpose categories in this sample were ``to discuss
	ongoing projects'' at 11.6 per cent and ``to routinely discuss the
	state of the business'' at 10.8 per cent. The two least common meeting
	purpose categories in this sample were ``to brainstorm for ideas
	or solutions'' at 3.3 per cent and ``to discuss productivity and
	efficiencies'' at 3.7 per cent. The taxonomy was analyzed across
	organizational type and employee job level to identify differences
	between those important organizational and employee characteristics.
	Research limitations/implications-- The data suggested that meetings
	were institutionalized in organizations, making them useful at identifying
	differences between organizations as well as differences in employees
	in terms of scope of responsibility. Researchers and managers should
	consider the purposes for which they call meetings and how that manifests
	their overarching organizational focus, structure and goals. Originality/value--
	This is the first study to overtly attempt to categorize the various
	purposes for which meetings are held. Further, this study develops
	a taxonomy of meeting purposes that will prove useful for investigating
	the different types of meeting purposes in a broad range of organizational
	types and structures.},

	topic in human robot interaction research, in particular since the
	development of increasingly human-like androids and computer graphics.
	In this paper we describe an empirical study that attempts to plot
	Mori's hypothesized curve. In addition, the influence of framing
	on the users' perception of the stimuli was investigated. Framing
	had no significant influence on the measurements. The pictures of
	robots and humans were rated independently of whether the participants
	knew a particular picture showed a robot or human. Anthropomorphism
	had a significant influence on the measurements, but not even pictures
	of real humans were rated as likeable as the pictures of humanoids
	or toy robots. As a result we suggest the existence of an uncanny
	cliff model as an alternative to the uncanny valley model. However,
	this study focused on the perception of pictures of robots and the
	results, including the suggested model, may be different for the
	perception of movies of moving robots or the perception of standing
	right in front of a moving robot.},

	had low team discretionary awards. Faultline distance further exacerbated
	the negative effects of strength in groups with social category faultlines

	in three dimensions. Such three-dimensional (3D) images, or holograms,
	can be seen with the unassisted eye and are very similar to how humans

	a real-time dynamic hologram depicting a scene occurring in a different
	location, has attracted considerable public interest since it was
	depicted in the original Star Wars film in 1977. However, the lack
	of sufficient computational power to produce realistic computer-generated
	holograms and the absence of large-area and dynamically updatable
	holographic recording media have prevented realization of the concept.
	Here we use a holographic stereographic technique and a photorefractive
	polymer material as the recording medium to demonstrate a holographic
	display that can refresh images every two seconds. A 50\textbackslashquotesinglbase{\"A}{\^a}Hz
	nanosecond pulsed laser is used to write the holographic pixels.
	Multicoloured holographic 3D images are produced by using angular
	multiplexing, and the full parallax display employs spatial multiplexing.
	3D telepresence is demonstrated by taking multiple images from one
	location and transmitting the information via Ethernet to another
	location where the hologram is printed with the quasi-real-time dynamic
	3D display. Further improvements could bring applications in telemedicine,
	prototyping, advertising, updatable 3D maps and entertainment.},

	Is this due to social expectation or due to coupled motion dynamics

	us to randomly assign apparent identity during free conversation
	in a video-conference, thereby dissociating apparent sex from motion
	dynamics. The method uses motion-tracked synthesized avatars that
	are accepted by naive participants as being live video. We find that
	1) motion dynamics affect head movements but that apparent sex does
	not; 2) judgments of sex are driven almost entirely by appearance;
	and 3) ratings of masculinity and femininity rely on a combination
	of both appearance and dynamics. Together, these findings are consistent
	with the hypothesis of separate perceptual streams for appearance
	and biological motion. In addition, our results are consistent with
	a view that head movements in conversation form a low level perception
	and action system that can operate independently from top-down social

	variables affecting communications media appropriateness in a survey

	factors: message urgency, amount of message content, and distance
	between communicators. Results indicated (1) situations have unique
	and significant contributions to media appropriateness; (2) appropriateness
	of media usage depends on the match between situation requirements
	and media characteristics, and (3) situation effects are more salient
	in some ?situation-dependent? media. Another survey of 1072 voice

	of social psychology that examines all of the countless cognitive
	complexities, mental representations, and processes implicated in

	context of the groups, cultures, and societies to which they belong.
	Together these two facets of social cognition create one of the most
	influential and important social sciences to come along in some time.
	Providing a comprehensive review of major topics in the field of
	social cognition, The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition expresses
	that excitement and fascination in describing the content and approach
	that constitute the field today. The 43 chapters included in this
	handbook cover: - central aspects of the field of social cognition,
	including its history and historically important foundational research
	areas (attribution, attitudes, impression formation, and prejudice/stereotyping),
	along with methodology - core issues relating to social cognitive
	representations and processes (including those that are visual, implicit,
	or automatic) and the stages of information processing (attention,
	perception, memory, and judgment, along with simulation and thought
	suppression) - applications of the social cognition approach to areas
	of social psychology, general psychology, and other disciplines,
	such as marketing, law, health and politics After more than 30 years,
	the vibrant field of social cognition continues to reign as one of
	psychology's most dominant approaches. The impressive chapters collected
	in this volume define the field and contribute enormously to our
	understanding of what social cognition is today.},

	automatically increases the likelihood of engaging in that behavior

	unintentionally matched that of strangers with whom they worked on
	a task. Experiment 2 had confederates mimic the posture and movements
	of participants and showed that mimicry facilitates the smoothness
	of interactions and increases liking between interaction partners.

	we propose a scheme to generate an octree of an object from its three
	orthogonal views (silhouettes) exploiting a volume intersection technique.
	A multi-level boundary search algorithm is developed to incorporate
	surface information into the octree representation. This makes the
	octree representation compact, informative, and especially useful
	for graphic displays and object recognition tasks. An algorithm is
	also designed for computing the moment of inertia matrix, which is
	useful for object recognition. All the algorithms developed in this
	study are essentially tree traversal procedures and therefore are

  abstract = {Due to the dramatic requirements of 3D games and applications, graphics
	processing unit (GPU) or general-purpose graphics processing unit
	(GPGPU) have become required components in the modern computer systems.
	While these devices enable high parallelism with huge amount of processing
	elements, the utilization of their capabilities in general scientific
	applications are still low due to their difficult programming paradigms.
	Therefore an open standard, OpenCL, is proposed to provide universal
	APIs and programming paradigms for various GPUs and accelerators.
	In this study, it adopts several benchmarks, with various computation
	characteristics, to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCL with several
	platforms. These programs are parallelized by OpenMP and OpenCL,
	and then targeted on several GPUs and conventional servers. This
	paper also provides an example to illustrate the migration of the
	given program, from OpenMP to OpenCL. The presented experimental
	results show that these inexpensive GPUs will lead better performance
	than servers if adopt OpenCL paradigms. It will be the preliminary
	milestone of cheap supercomputing by the acceleration of GPUs that
	can be obtained ubiquitously.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm is proposed for novel view generation in one-to-one
	teleconferencing applications. Given the video streams acquired by
	two cameras placed on either side of a computer monitor, the proposed
	algorithm synthesizes images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position
	(typically located within the monitor) to facilitate eye contact.
	Our technique is based on an improved, dynamic-programming, stereo
	algorithm for efficient novel-view generation. The two main contributions
	are: i) a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming,
	that encourages correct occlusion labeling; ii) a compact geometric
	derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost
	surface. Furthermore, we present a novel algorithm for the temporal
	maintenance of a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions
	and reduce temporal artefacts (flicker); and a cost aggregation algorithm
	that acts directly on our three-dimensional matching cost space.
	Examples are given that demonstrate the robustness of the new algorithm
	to spatial and temporal artefacts for long stereo video streams.
	These include demonstrations of synthesis of cyclopean views of extended
	conversational sequences. We further demonstrate synthesis from a
	freely translating virtual camera.},

	with the ability to handle multimedia data; more and more of us are
	linked by high-speed digital networks. With multimedia communication
	environments becoming more commonplace, what have we learned from
	earlier experiences with prototype media environments? This paper
	reports on some of our experiences as developers, researchers and
	users of flexible, networked, multimedia computer environments, or
	``media spaces''. It focusses on the lessons we can learn from extended,
	long-term use of media spaces, with connections that last not hours
	or days, but months or years. We take as our starting point a set
	of assumptions which differ from traditional analytical perspectives.
	In particular, we begin from the position that that real-world baseline
	is not always an appropriate point of comparison for new media technologies;
	that a set of complex and intricate communicative behaviours arise
	over time; and that media spaces connect not only individuals, but
	the wider social groups of which they form part. We outline a framework
	based on four perspectives --- individual, interactional, communal
	and societal --- from which to view the behaviour of individuals
	and groups linked by multimedia environments. On the basis of our
	long-term findings, we argue for a view of media spaces which, first,
	focuses on a wider interpretation of media space interaction than
	the traditional view of person-to-person connections, and, second,
	emphasises emergent communicative practices, rather than looking
	for the transfer of face-to-face behaviours.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computer-generated virtual faces become increasingly realistic
	including the simulation of emotional expressions. These faces can
	be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion
	research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in
	comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for
	the different emotions and different age groups. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and
	60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters
	(avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness,
	anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual
	emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition
	differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions:
	whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology,
	virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than
	natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for
	virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40.
	This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence
	on emotion recognition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Virtual and natural
	facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology
	(e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even
	better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with
	which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated
	artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future
	research and therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Purpose-- Managers spend a great deal of time in meetings making decisions
	critical to organisational success, yet the design aspects of meetings
	remain largely understudied. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate
	on the potential impact of one critical design aspect of meetings
	-- namely, whether a decision to be taken (or the meeting in general)
	was scheduled or not -- on the use of distributed information, information
	elaboration, conflict, speed of decision making, and, ultimately,
	decision-making effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach-- The
	research presented in this paper combines a literature review with
	empirical data obtained from questionnaires and direct observation
	of decision making meetings on organisational issues in a hospital.
	One meeting was scheduled, the other two were unscheduled. A second
	questionnaire was administered 12 months after the respective decision
	making meetings to explore and evaluate the efficiency of the decisions
	made and their implementation. Findings-- This paper suggests that
	a scheduled meeting with a shared agenda of all decisions to be taken
	may induce decision makers to form opinions upfront at the meeting,
	with these opinions eventually serving as sources of conflict during
	group discussion. Because of the nature of the conflict generated,
	these meetings are more likely to run long and to not deliver the
	expected outcomes. Originality/value-- The study contributes to the
	debate on group decision-making processes by examining the effect
	of meeting scheduling on information elaboration and conflict in
	real-world decision-making settings. Although robust evidence has
	supported the existence of relationships between information elaboration,
	conflict, and decision-making effectiveness, previous studies have
	mainly focused on the effects of these processes during scheduled
	meetings and experimental settings. The findings of the present study
	show the effect of meeting scheduling on decision-making effectiveness
	in real-world settings.},

	camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions,
	it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual
	information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the
	vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation,
	and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive
	feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel
	feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which
	utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization.
	Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from
	one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable.
	We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery,
	allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable.
	The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult
	video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show
	that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable
	tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity.},

	contact problem robust depth maps are required. For this purpose,
	in this paper we will discuss the fusion of two competing approaches
	which have, from a camera configuration point of view, contrary to
	each other properties. Namely, we will combine the volumetric Visual
	Hull (VH) approach with the stereo matching based Hybrid Recursive
	Matching (HRM) to a new method which benefits from the advantages
	of both techniques and discards their weak points.},

	Although the issue of `attention getting' and its importance for
	interpersonal interaction is well recognized in the video-mediated
	communication literature there is very little empirical evidence
	as to the relative effectiveness of the various attributes of attention-getting
	signals. The objective of this study was to compare the response
	times and error rates of four attention-getting devices which were
	suitable for a particular application of video-mediated communication
	in the educational sector. Twelve subjects (eight female and four
	male), classroom instructors aged 35--55 years, participated in the
	study. Four attention-getting devices were tested in this experiment:
	a red light, a yellow rotating light, a wire hand, and a fan with
	ribbon streamers. Each device was tested three times in three different
	classrooms during an actual class with actual instructors (the subjects).
	A one-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference
	in response time for the four devices with the yellow light and the
	metal hand being fastest. This preliminary study points out the importance
	of empirically testing the effectiveness of attention-getting devices
	of differing characteristics since, of the four devices tested here,
	two could be expected to elicit the most immediate response from
	a communication partner.},

	the exact amount of payments to be made in an ordinary two-person

	of this principle seems satisfactory in the experiments. One experiment
	suggests that, in a sequence of trials in the same game situation,
	people tend to start near an equilibrium point and then try to find
	a better equilibrium, if there is one. The experiments show examples
	of non-optimal behavior of the bargainers when the judgment necessary

	The model integrates two areas of research. One body of work posits

	These choices involve evaluating communication options and selecting
	an appropriate medium to match the communication requirements of
	the task. The second perspective is social information processing
	theory (Salancik \& Pfeffer, 1978). This approach proposes that attitudes
	and behaviors are partially determined by information embedded in
	the social context. The synthesis of these perspectives asserts that
	media characteristics and attitudes are in part socially constructed.
	Furthermore, attitudes are influenced by attributions based on observations
	of one's own past behavior. This model is shown to explain a wider
	range of existing empirical findings. Also, new propositions are
	derived to guide future research. This social construction model
	of media use has significant implications for the design, conduct,

	64 (3 Part 2), 1275-1278]. One explanation for these findings is
	that gaze acts as an arousal stimulus, which increases attentional
	focus and therefore enhances memory [Kelley, D.H., Gorham, J., 1988.
	Effects of immediacy on recall of information. Commun. Edu. 37(3),
	198-207]. Two studies were conducted in order to test whether gazing
	at the camera during video-mediated presentations resulted in similar
	benefits as mutual gaze in a face-to-face context. In study 1 a confederate
	presented information about two fictitious soap products. In one
	condition, the confederate gazed at the camera for 30\% of the presentation,
	therefore giving the participants the impression that he was gazing
	in their direction. In the other condition the confederate did not
	gaze at the camera. Participants viewed the sales presentations from
	both conditions. In the condition where gaze was directed at the
	camera, participants recalled significantly more information about
	the sales presentation. Study 2 employed the same pre-recorded sales
	presentations used in study 1, however they were delivered to the
	participants under audio-only conditions (therefore, the image was
	switched off). Results from study 2 indicated no recall differences
	between the two conditions. Findings from these studies would seem
	to indicate that the perception of gaze aversion over a video link
	(a consequence of the salesman not looking into the camera) has a
	negative impact on information recall. This has practical implications
	for video-mediated presentations. In a distance learning environment
	lecturers could be advised to look into the camera in order to promote
	more efficient learning in students.},

	at bridging the current fragmentation of the work in this domain,
	currently split among half a dozen technical communities. The review
	is organized around the main themes studied in the literature and

  year = {1999},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {419--429},
  abstract = {People move their hands as they talk - they gesture. Gesturing is
	a robust phenomenon, found across cultures, ages, and tasks. Gesture
	is even found in individuals blind from birth. But what purpose,
	if any, does gesture serve? In this review, I begin by examining
	gesture when it stands on its own, substituting for speech and clearly
	serving a communicative function. When called upon to carry the full
	burden of communication, gesture assumes a language-like form, with
	structure at word and sentence levels. However, when produced along
	with speech, gesture assumes a different form - it becomes imagistic
	and analog. Despite its form, the gesture that accompanies speech
	also communicates. Trained coders can glean substantive information
	from gesture - information that is not always identical to that gleaned
	from speech. Gesture can thus serve as a research tool, shedding
	light on speakers' unspoken thoughts. The controversial question
	is whether gesture conveys information to listeners not trained to
	read them. Do spontaneous gestures communicate to ordinary listeners?
	Or might they be produced only for speakers themselves? I suggest
	these are not mutually exclusive functions - gesture serves as both
	a tool for communication for listeners, and a tool for thinking for
	speakers.},

  year = {2000},
  volume = {32},
  pages = {1489--1522},
  number = {10},

  abstract = {A theory of action must come to terms with both the details of language
	use and the way in which the social, cultural, material and sequential
	structure of the environment where action occurs figure into its
	organization. In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial
	site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists
	of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry
	out courses of action in concert with each other through talk while
	attending to both the larger activities that their current actions
	are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using
	as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists
	classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught
	the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of
	semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with
	alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social
	action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing
	activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays
	of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used
	in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena
	that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both
	talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities
	in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the
	surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic
	structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action
	being invoked through talk would be impossible. In brief it will
	be argued that the construction of action through talk within situated
	interaction is accomplished through the temporally unfolding juxtaposition
	of quite different kinds of semiotic resources, and that moreover
	through this process the human body is made publicly visible as the
	site for a range of structurally different kinds of displays implicated
	in the constitution of the actions of the moment.},

	This paper presents the vision-based technology which allows one
	in such a setup to significantly enhance the perceptual power of
	the computer. The described techniques for tracking a face using
	a convex-shape nose feature as well as for face-tracking with two
	off-the-shelf cameras allow one to track faces robustly and precisely
	in both 2D and 3D with low resolution cameras. Supplemented by the
	mechanism for detecting multiple eye blinks, this technology provides
	a complete solution for building intelligent hands-free input devices.
	The theory behind the technology is presented. The results from running
	several perceptual user interfaces built with this technology are
	shown.},
