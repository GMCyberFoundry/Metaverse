  abstract = {Purpose-- The purpose of this study is to propose a taxonomy of meeting
	purpose. Meetings are a workplace activity that deserves increased
	attention from researchers and practitioners. Previous researchers
	attempted to develop typologies of meeting purpose with limited success.
	Through a comparison of classification methodologies, the authors
	consider a taxonomy as the appropriate classification scheme for
	meeting purpose. The authors then utilize the developed taxonomy
	to investigate the frequency with which a representative sample of
	working adults engaged in meetings of these varying purposes. Their
	proposed taxonomy provides relevant classifications for future research
	on meetings as well and serves as a useful tool for managers seeking
	to use and evaluate the effectiveness of meetings within their organizations.
	Design/methodology/approach-- This study employs an inductive methodology
	using discourse analysis of qualitative meeting descriptions to develop
	a taxonomy of meeting purpose. The authors discourse analysis utilizes
	open-ended survey responses from a sample of working adults (n =
	491). Findings-- The authors categorical analysis of open-ended questions
	resulted in a 16-category taxonomy of meeting purpose. The two most
	prevalent meeting purpose categories in this sample were ``to discuss
	ongoing projects'' at 11.6 per cent and ``to routinely discuss the
	state of the business'' at 10.8 per cent. The two least common meeting
	purpose categories in this sample were ``to brainstorm for ideas
	or solutions'' at 3.3 per cent and ``to discuss productivity and
	efficiencies'' at 3.7 per cent. The taxonomy was analyzed across
	organizational type and employee job level to identify differences
	between those important organizational and employee characteristics.
	Research limitations/implications-- The data suggested that meetings
	were institutionalized in organizations, making them useful at identifying
	differences between organizations as well as differences in employees
	in terms of scope of responsibility. Researchers and managers should
	consider the purposes for which they call meetings and how that manifests
	their overarching organizational focus, structure and goals. Originality/value--
	This is the first study to overtly attempt to categorize the various
	purposes for which meetings are held. Further, this study develops
	a taxonomy of meeting purposes that will prove useful for investigating
	the different types of meeting purposes in a broad range of organizational
	types and structures.},

	topic in human robot interaction research, in particular since the
	development of increasingly human-like androids and computer graphics.
	In this paper we describe an empirical study that attempts to plot
	Mori's hypothesized curve. In addition, the influence of framing
	on the users' perception of the stimuli was investigated. Framing
	had no significant influence on the measurements. The pictures of
	robots and humans were rated independently of whether the participants
	knew a particular picture showed a robot or human. Anthropomorphism
	had a significant influence on the measurements, but not even pictures
	of real humans were rated as likeable as the pictures of humanoids
	or toy robots. As a result we suggest the existence of an uncanny
	cliff model as an alternative to the uncanny valley model. However,
	this study focused on the perception of pictures of robots and the
	results, including the suggested model, may be different for the
	perception of movies of moving robots or the perception of standing
	right in front of a moving robot.},

	had low team discretionary awards. Faultline distance further exacerbated
	the negative effects of strength in groups with social category faultlines

	in three dimensions. Such three-dimensional (3D) images, or holograms,
	can be seen with the unassisted eye and are very similar to how humans

	a real-time dynamic hologram depicting a scene occurring in a different
	location, has attracted considerable public interest since it was
	depicted in the original Star Wars film in 1977. However, the lack
	of sufficient computational power to produce realistic computer-generated
	holograms and the absence of large-area and dynamically updatable
	holographic recording media have prevented realization of the concept.
	Here we use a holographic stereographic technique and a photorefractive
	polymer material as the recording medium to demonstrate a holographic
	display that can refresh images every two seconds. A 50\textbackslashquotesinglbase{\"A}{\^a}Hz
	nanosecond pulsed laser is used to write the holographic pixels.
	Multicoloured holographic 3D images are produced by using angular
	multiplexing, and the full parallax display employs spatial multiplexing.
	3D telepresence is demonstrated by taking multiple images from one
	location and transmitting the information via Ethernet to another
	location where the hologram is printed with the quasi-real-time dynamic
	3D display. Further improvements could bring applications in telemedicine,
	prototyping, advertising, updatable 3D maps and entertainment.},

	Is this due to social expectation or due to coupled motion dynamics

	us to randomly assign apparent identity during free conversation
	in a video-conference, thereby dissociating apparent sex from motion
	dynamics. The method uses motion-tracked synthesized avatars that
	are accepted by naive participants as being live video. We find that
	1) motion dynamics affect head movements but that apparent sex does
	not; 2) judgments of sex are driven almost entirely by appearance;
	and 3) ratings of masculinity and femininity rely on a combination
	of both appearance and dynamics. Together, these findings are consistent
	with the hypothesis of separate perceptual streams for appearance
	and biological motion. In addition, our results are consistent with
	a view that head movements in conversation form a low level perception
	and action system that can operate independently from top-down social

	variables affecting communications media appropriateness in a survey

	factors: message urgency, amount of message content, and distance
	between communicators. Results indicated (1) situations have unique
	and significant contributions to media appropriateness; (2) appropriateness
	of media usage depends on the match between situation requirements
	and media characteristics, and (3) situation effects are more salient
	in some ?situation-dependent? media. Another survey of 1072 voice

	of social psychology that examines all of the countless cognitive
	complexities, mental representations, and processes implicated in

	context of the groups, cultures, and societies to which they belong.
	Together these two facets of social cognition create one of the most
	influential and important social sciences to come along in some time.
	Providing a comprehensive review of major topics in the field of
	social cognition, The Oxford Handbook of Social Cognition expresses
	that excitement and fascination in describing the content and approach
	that constitute the field today. The 43 chapters included in this
	handbook cover: - central aspects of the field of social cognition,
	including its history and historically important foundational research
	areas (attribution, attitudes, impression formation, and prejudice/stereotyping),
	along with methodology - core issues relating to social cognitive
	representations and processes (including those that are visual, implicit,
	or automatic) and the stages of information processing (attention,
	perception, memory, and judgment, along with simulation and thought
	suppression) - applications of the social cognition approach to areas
	of social psychology, general psychology, and other disciplines,
	such as marketing, law, health and politics After more than 30 years,
	the vibrant field of social cognition continues to reign as one of
	psychology's most dominant approaches. The impressive chapters collected
	in this volume define the field and contribute enormously to our
	understanding of what social cognition is today.},

	automatically increases the likelihood of engaging in that behavior

	unintentionally matched that of strangers with whom they worked on
	a task. Experiment 2 had confederates mimic the posture and movements
	of participants and showed that mimicry facilitates the smoothness
	of interactions and increases liking between interaction partners.

	we propose a scheme to generate an octree of an object from its three
	orthogonal views (silhouettes) exploiting a volume intersection technique.
	A multi-level boundary search algorithm is developed to incorporate
	surface information into the octree representation. This makes the
	octree representation compact, informative, and especially useful
	for graphic displays and object recognition tasks. An algorithm is
	also designed for computing the moment of inertia matrix, which is
	useful for object recognition. All the algorithms developed in this
	study are essentially tree traversal procedures and therefore are

  abstract = {Due to the dramatic requirements of 3D games and applications, graphics
	processing unit (GPU) or general-purpose graphics processing unit
	(GPGPU) have become required components in the modern computer systems.
	While these devices enable high parallelism with huge amount of processing
	elements, the utilization of their capabilities in general scientific
	applications are still low due to their difficult programming paradigms.
	Therefore an open standard, OpenCL, is proposed to provide universal
	APIs and programming paradigms for various GPUs and accelerators.
	In this study, it adopts several benchmarks, with various computation
	characteristics, to demonstrate the capabilities of OpenCL with several
	platforms. These programs are parallelized by OpenMP and OpenCL,
	and then targeted on several GPUs and conventional servers. This
	paper also provides an example to illustrate the migration of the
	given program, from OpenMP to OpenCL. The presented experimental
	results show that these inexpensive GPUs will lead better performance
	than servers if adopt OpenCL paradigms. It will be the preliminary
	milestone of cheap supercomputing by the acceleration of GPUs that
	can be obtained ubiquitously.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm is proposed for novel view generation in one-to-one
	teleconferencing applications. Given the video streams acquired by
	two cameras placed on either side of a computer monitor, the proposed
	algorithm synthesizes images from a virtual camera in arbitrary position
	(typically located within the monitor) to facilitate eye contact.
	Our technique is based on an improved, dynamic-programming, stereo
	algorithm for efficient novel-view generation. The two main contributions
	are: i) a new type of three-plane graph for dense-stereo dynamic-programming,
	that encourages correct occlusion labeling; ii) a compact geometric
	derivation for novel-view synthesis by direct projection of the minimum-cost
	surface. Furthermore, we present a novel algorithm for the temporal
	maintenance of a background model to enhance the rendering of occlusions
	and reduce temporal artefacts (flicker); and a cost aggregation algorithm
	that acts directly on our three-dimensional matching cost space.
	Examples are given that demonstrate the robustness of the new algorithm
	to spatial and temporal artefacts for long stereo video streams.
	These include demonstrations of synthesis of cyclopean views of extended
	conversational sequences. We further demonstrate synthesis from a
	freely translating virtual camera.},

	with the ability to handle multimedia data; more and more of us are
	linked by high-speed digital networks. With multimedia communication
	environments becoming more commonplace, what have we learned from
	earlier experiences with prototype media environments? This paper
	reports on some of our experiences as developers, researchers and
	users of flexible, networked, multimedia computer environments, or
	``media spaces''. It focusses on the lessons we can learn from extended,
	long-term use of media spaces, with connections that last not hours
	or days, but months or years. We take as our starting point a set
	of assumptions which differ from traditional analytical perspectives.
	In particular, we begin from the position that that real-world baseline
	is not always an appropriate point of comparison for new media technologies;
	that a set of complex and intricate communicative behaviours arise
	over time; and that media spaces connect not only individuals, but
	the wider social groups of which they form part. We outline a framework
	based on four perspectives --- individual, interactional, communal
	and societal --- from which to view the behaviour of individuals
	and groups linked by multimedia environments. On the basis of our
	long-term findings, we argue for a view of media spaces which, first,
	focuses on a wider interpretation of media space interaction than
	the traditional view of person-to-person connections, and, second,
	emphasises emergent communicative practices, rather than looking
	for the transfer of face-to-face behaviours.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Computer-generated virtual faces become increasingly realistic
	including the simulation of emotional expressions. These faces can
	be used as well-controlled, realistic and dynamic stimuli in emotion
	research. However, the validity of virtual facial expressions in
	comparison to natural emotion displays still needs to be shown for
	the different emotions and different age groups. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: Thirty-two healthy volunteers between the age of 20 and
	60 rated pictures of natural human faces and faces of virtual characters
	(avatars) with respect to the expressed emotions: happiness, sadness,
	anger, fear, disgust, and neutral. Results indicate that virtual
	emotions were recognized comparable to natural ones. Recognition
	differences in virtual and natural faces depended on specific emotions:
	whereas disgust was difficult to convey with the current avatar technology,
	virtual sadness and fear achieved better recognition results than
	natural faces. Furthermore, emotion recognition rates decreased for
	virtual but not natural faces in participants over the age of 40.
	This specific age effect suggests that media exposure has an influence
	on emotion recognition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Virtual and natural
	facial displays of emotion may be equally effective. Improved technology
	(e.g. better modelling of the naso-labial area) may lead to even
	better results as compared to trained actors. Due to the ease with
	which virtual human faces can be animated and manipulated, validated
	artificial emotional expressions will be of major relevance in future
	research and therapeutic applications.},

  abstract = {Purpose-- Managers spend a great deal of time in meetings making decisions
	critical to organisational success, yet the design aspects of meetings
	remain largely understudied. The purpose of this paper is to elaborate
	on the potential impact of one critical design aspect of meetings
	-- namely, whether a decision to be taken (or the meeting in general)
	was scheduled or not -- on the use of distributed information, information
	elaboration, conflict, speed of decision making, and, ultimately,
	decision-making effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach-- The
	research presented in this paper combines a literature review with
	empirical data obtained from questionnaires and direct observation
	of decision making meetings on organisational issues in a hospital.
	One meeting was scheduled, the other two were unscheduled. A second
	questionnaire was administered 12 months after the respective decision
	making meetings to explore and evaluate the efficiency of the decisions
	made and their implementation. Findings-- This paper suggests that
	a scheduled meeting with a shared agenda of all decisions to be taken
	may induce decision makers to form opinions upfront at the meeting,
	with these opinions eventually serving as sources of conflict during
	group discussion. Because of the nature of the conflict generated,
	these meetings are more likely to run long and to not deliver the
	expected outcomes. Originality/value-- The study contributes to the
	debate on group decision-making processes by examining the effect
	of meeting scheduling on information elaboration and conflict in
	real-world decision-making settings. Although robust evidence has
	supported the existence of relationships between information elaboration,
	conflict, and decision-making effectiveness, previous studies have
	mainly focused on the effects of these processes during scheduled
	meetings and experimental settings. The findings of the present study
	show the effect of meeting scheduling on decision-making effectiveness
	in real-world settings.},

	camera rig. To achieve reliable performance under real-world conditions,
	it has long been advocated to extract and combine as much visual
	information as possible. We propose a way to closely integrate the
	vision modules for visual odometry, pedestrian detection, depth estimation,
	and tracking. The integration naturally leads to several cognitive
	feedback loops between the modules. Among others, we propose a novel
	feedback connection from the object detector to visual odometry which
	utilizes the semantic knowledge of detection to stabilize localization.
	Feedback loops always carry the danger that erroneous feedback from
	one module is amplified and causes the entire system to become instable.
	We therefore incorporate automatic failure detection and recovery,
	allowing the system to continue when a module becomes unreliable.
	The approach is experimentally evaluated on several long and difficult
	video sequences from busy inner-city locations. Our results show
	that the proposed integration makes it possible to deliver stable
	tracking performance in scenes of previously infeasible complexity.},

	contact problem robust depth maps are required. For this purpose,
	in this paper we will discuss the fusion of two competing approaches
	which have, from a camera configuration point of view, contrary to
	each other properties. Namely, we will combine the volumetric Visual
	Hull (VH) approach with the stereo matching based Hybrid Recursive
	Matching (HRM) to a new method which benefits from the advantages
	of both techniques and discards their weak points.},

	Although the issue of `attention getting' and its importance for
	interpersonal interaction is well recognized in the video-mediated
	communication literature there is very little empirical evidence
	as to the relative effectiveness of the various attributes of attention-getting
	signals. The objective of this study was to compare the response
	times and error rates of four attention-getting devices which were
	suitable for a particular application of video-mediated communication
	in the educational sector. Twelve subjects (eight female and four
	male), classroom instructors aged 35--55 years, participated in the
	study. Four attention-getting devices were tested in this experiment:
	a red light, a yellow rotating light, a wire hand, and a fan with
	ribbon streamers. Each device was tested three times in three different
	classrooms during an actual class with actual instructors (the subjects).
	A one-way analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference
	in response time for the four devices with the yellow light and the
	metal hand being fastest. This preliminary study points out the importance
	of empirically testing the effectiveness of attention-getting devices
	of differing characteristics since, of the four devices tested here,
	two could be expected to elicit the most immediate response from
	a communication partner.},

	the exact amount of payments to be made in an ordinary two-person

	of this principle seems satisfactory in the experiments. One experiment
	suggests that, in a sequence of trials in the same game situation,
	people tend to start near an equilibrium point and then try to find
	a better equilibrium, if there is one. The experiments show examples
	of non-optimal behavior of the bargainers when the judgment necessary

	The model integrates two areas of research. One body of work posits

	These choices involve evaluating communication options and selecting
	an appropriate medium to match the communication requirements of
	the task. The second perspective is social information processing
	theory (Salancik \& Pfeffer, 1978). This approach proposes that attitudes
	and behaviors are partially determined by information embedded in
	the social context. The synthesis of these perspectives asserts that
	media characteristics and attitudes are in part socially constructed.
	Furthermore, attitudes are influenced by attributions based on observations
	of one's own past behavior. This model is shown to explain a wider
	range of existing empirical findings. Also, new propositions are
	derived to guide future research. This social construction model
	of media use has significant implications for the design, conduct,

	64 (3 Part 2), 1275-1278]. One explanation for these findings is
	that gaze acts as an arousal stimulus, which increases attentional
	focus and therefore enhances memory [Kelley, D.H., Gorham, J., 1988.
	Effects of immediacy on recall of information. Commun. Edu. 37(3),
	198-207]. Two studies were conducted in order to test whether gazing
	at the camera during video-mediated presentations resulted in similar
	benefits as mutual gaze in a face-to-face context. In study 1 a confederate
	presented information about two fictitious soap products. In one
	condition, the confederate gazed at the camera for 30\% of the presentation,
	therefore giving the participants the impression that he was gazing
	in their direction. In the other condition the confederate did not
	gaze at the camera. Participants viewed the sales presentations from
	both conditions. In the condition where gaze was directed at the
	camera, participants recalled significantly more information about
	the sales presentation. Study 2 employed the same pre-recorded sales
	presentations used in study 1, however they were delivered to the
	participants under audio-only conditions (therefore, the image was
	switched off). Results from study 2 indicated no recall differences
	between the two conditions. Findings from these studies would seem
	to indicate that the perception of gaze aversion over a video link
	(a consequence of the salesman not looking into the camera) has a
	negative impact on information recall. This has practical implications
	for video-mediated presentations. In a distance learning environment
	lecturers could be advised to look into the camera in order to promote
	more efficient learning in students.},

	at bridging the current fragmentation of the work in this domain,
	currently split among half a dozen technical communities. The review
	is organized around the main themes studied in the literature and

  abstract = {People move their hands as they talk - they gesture. Gesturing is
	a robust phenomenon, found across cultures, ages, and tasks. Gesture
	is even found in individuals blind from birth. But what purpose,
	if any, does gesture serve? In this review, I begin by examining
	gesture when it stands on its own, substituting for speech and clearly
	serving a communicative function. When called upon to carry the full
	burden of communication, gesture assumes a language-like form, with
	structure at word and sentence levels. However, when produced along
	with speech, gesture assumes a different form - it becomes imagistic
	and analog. Despite its form, the gesture that accompanies speech
	also communicates. Trained coders can glean substantive information
	from gesture - information that is not always identical to that gleaned
	from speech. Gesture can thus serve as a research tool, shedding
	light on speakers' unspoken thoughts. The controversial question
	is whether gesture conveys information to listeners not trained to
	read them. Do spontaneous gestures communicate to ordinary listeners?
	Or might they be produced only for speakers themselves? I suggest
	these are not mutually exclusive functions - gesture serves as both
	a tool for communication for listeners, and a tool for thinking for
	speakers.},

	use and the way in which the social, cultural, material and sequential
	structure of the environment where action occurs figure into its
	organization. In this paper it will be suggested that a primordial
	site for the analysis of human language, cognition, and action consists
	of a situation in which multiple participants are attempting to carry
	out courses of action in concert with each other through talk while
	attending to both the larger activities that their current actions
	are ambedded within, and relevant phenomena in their surround. Using
	as data video recordings of young girls playing hopscotch and archaeologists
	classifying color, it will be argued that human action is built throught
	the simultaneous deployment of a range of quite different kinds of
	semiotic resources. Talk itself contains multiple sign systems with
	alternative properties. Strips of talk gain their power as social
	action via their placement within larger sequential structures, encompassing
	activities, and participation frameworks constituted through displays
	of mutual orientation made by the actors' bodies. The body is used
	in a quite different way to perform gesture, again a class of phenomena
	that encompasses structurally different types of sign systems. Both
	talk and gesture can index, construe or treat as irrelevant, entities
	in the participants' surround. Moreover, material structure in the
	surround, such as graphic fields of various types, can provide semiotic
	structure without which the constitution of particular kinds of action
	being invoked through talk would be impossible. In brief it will
	be argued that the construction of action through talk within situated
	interaction is accomplished through the temporally unfolding juxtaposition
	of quite different kinds of semiotic resources, and that moreover
	through this process the human body is made publicly visible as the
	site for a range of structurally different kinds of displays implicated
	in the constitution of the actions of the moment.},

	an understanding of theory. A taxonomy is proposed that classifies
	information systems theories with respect to the manner in which
	four central goals are addressed: analysis, explanation, prediction,
	and prescription. Five interrelated types of theory are distinguished:
	(1) theory for analyzing, (2) theory for explaining, (3) theory for
	predicting, (4) theory for explaining and predicting, and (5) theory
	for design and action. Examples illustrate the nature of each theory
	type. The applicability of the taxonomy is demonstrated by classifying
	a sample of journal articles. The paper contributes by showing that
	multiple views of theory exist and by exposing the assumptions underlying
	different viewpoints. In addition, it is suggested that the type

	can transmit affect messages. A man and a woman assumed---facial

	These expressions were shown in still photographs and in live portrayals
	to 49 observers who composed four groups which were 30, 35, 40, and
	45 meters away from the stimuli. Photographs and live portrayals
	produced comparable results. Every observer was able to label the
	expressions accurately although accuracy declined as distance increased.
	Extrapolation from the data suggested that some messages may be sent
	far beyond the distances used in this study. These results raise
	important issues about the transmission of facial signals over distance
	and suggest that the face is a long-distance transmitter of affect
	signals.},

	The intent of our research is to learn whether there are elements
	in existing group communication patterns that suggest how future
	communication systems can be designed or selected to fit the actual
	work relationships of a group. A detailed social network survey provided
	information about what members of the group communicated about, how

	was done through a combination of media, but predominately through
	unscheduled encounters, electronic mail, and scheduled meetings;
	people rarely videoconferenced, telephoned, or faxed. Factor analysis
	reduced the 24 work relationships to six distinct dimensions: receiving
	work, giving work, collaborative writing, major emotional support,
	sociability, and computer programming. The proportion in which the
	three main media were used varied according to the nature of the
	work dimension. Our findings suggest that a multivariate perspective

	(IPTs) offer users the possibility of collaborating intuitively in

	there are currently no studies for collaborative interaction using
	IPTs. The aim of this paper is to examine how immersive technologies

	systems. A study of collaboration is presented where two partners
	worked together using networked IPT environments. The data collected
	included observations, analysis of video and audio recordings, questionnaires
	and debriefing interviews from both IPT sites. This paper focuses
	on the successes and failures in collaboration through detailed examination
	of particular incidents during the interaction. We compare these
	successes and failures with the findings of a study by Hindmarsh,
	Fraser, Heath, \& Benford (Computer Supported Collaborative Work,
	CSCW'98, 1998, pp. 217?226) that examined object-focused interaction
	on a desktop-based CVE system. Our findings identify situations where
	interaction is better supported with the IPT system than the desktop
	system, and situations where interaction is not as well supported.
	We also present examples of how social interaction is critical to

	and found that gesture had a tight relation to the children's lexical
	and syntactic development. First, a great many of the lexical items
	that each child produced initially in gesture later moved to that
	child's verbal lexicon. Second, children who were first to produce
	gesture-plus-word combinations conveying two elements in a proposition
	(point at bird and say ``nap'') were also first to produce two-word
	combinations (``bird nap''). Changes in gesture thus not only predate
	but also predict changes in language, suggesting that early gesture
	may be paving the way for future developments in language.},

	that both types of representation are deeply linked to thought processes.
	They are linked to learning, the ability to use existing knowledge,
	and problem solving strategies. The links between representations,
	thought processes, and behavior are so deep that even eye movements
	are partly governed by representations. Choice of representations
	can affect limited cognitive resources like attention and short-term
	memory by forcing a person to try to utilize poorly organized information
	or perform `translations' from one representation to another. The
	implications of this evidence are discussed. Based on these findings,
	a set of guidelines are presented, for digital representations which
	minimize drain of cognitive resources. These guidelines describe
	what sorts of characteristics and behaviors a representation should
	exhibit, and what sorts of information it should contain in order
	to accommodate and facilitate design. Current attempts to implement
	such representations are discussed.},

	if specific features can be identified that contribute to the recognition

	(Prisoner's Dilemma, Assurance, Chicken) and multiple-person social
	dilemmas (public goods dilemmas and commons dilemmas) are examined.
	The second part is an extended treatment of possible solutions for
	social dilemmas. These solutions are organized into three broad categories
	based on whether the solutions assume egoistic actors and whether
	the structure of the situation can be changed: Motivational solutions
	assume actors are not completely egoistic and so give some weight
	to the outcomes of their partners. Strategic solutions assume egoistic
	actors, and neither of these categories of solutions involve changing
	the fundamental structure of the situation. Solutions that do involve
	changing the rules of the game are considered in the section on structural

	suggesting that head and gaze are mutually influential in the analysis

	a cross-modal version of the task (Experiment 3) where participants

  abstract = {Many algorithms for both identifying and reconstructing a 3-D object
	are based on the 2-D silhouettes of the object. In general, identifying
	a nonconvex object using a silhouette-based approach implies neglecting
	some features of its surface as identification clues. The same features
	cannot be reconstructed by volume intersection techniques using multiple
	silhouettes of the object. This paper addresses the problem of finding
	which parts of a nonconvex object are relevant for silhouette-based
	image understanding. For this purpose, the geometric concept of visual
	hull of a 3-D object is introduced. This is the closest approximation
	of object S that can be obtained with the volume intersection approach;
	it is the maximal object silhouette-equivalent to S, i.e., which
	can be substituted for S without affecting any silhouette. Only the
	parts of the surface of S that also lie on the surface of the visual
	hull can be reconstructed or identified using silhouette-based algorithms.
	The visual hull depends not only on the object but also on the region
	allowed to the viewpoint. Two main viewing regions result in the
	external and internal visual hull. In the former case the viewing
	region is related to the convex hull of S, in the latter it is bounded
	by S. The internal visual hull also admits an interpretation not
	related to silhouettes. Algorithms for computing visual hulls are
	presented and their complexity analyzed. In general, the visual hull
	of a 3-D planar face object turns out to be bounded by planar and
	curved patches.},

	are available on the image plane, and (2) the geometry of head and
	lengths of body segments formed by joints are known. First of all,
	the feature points on the head in the head-centered coordinate system
	and their image projections are used to determine a transformation
	matrix. Then, the camera position and orientations are extracted
	from the matrix. Finally, the 3D coordinates of the head points expressed
	in the camera-centered coordinate system are obtained. Starting from
	the coordinates of the neck, which is a head feature point, the 3D
	coordinates of other joints one-by-one are determined under the assumption
	of the fixed lengths of the body segments. A binary interpretation
	tree is used to represent the 2n − 1 possible body structures, if
	a human body has n joints. To determine the final feasible body structures,
	physical and motion constraints are used to prune the interpretation
	tree. Formulas and rules required for the tree pruning are formulated.
	Experiments are used to illustrate the pruning powers of these constraints.
	In the two cases of input data chosen, a unique or nearly unique

	Extending work of this kind, the present research investigated the

	from semantic memory. It was anticipated that gaze direction would

	expected to influence both the speed with which targets could be
	categorized as men and women and the rate at which associated stereotypic

	contours) of an object rotating on a turntable in front of a single
	camera. A practical and accurate technique for solving this problem
	from profiles alone is developed. It is precise enough to reconstruct
	the shape of the object. No correspondences between points or lines
	are necessary. Symmetry of the surface of revolution swept out by
	the rotating object is exploited to obtain the image of the rotation
	axis and the homography relating epipolar lines in two views robustly
	and elegantly. These, together with geometric constraints for images
	of rotating objects, are used to obtain first the image of the horizon,
	which is the projection of the plane that contains the camera centers,
	and then the epipoles, thus fully determining the epipolar geometry
	of the image sequence. The estimation of this geometry by this sequential
	approach avoids many of the problems found in other algorithms. The
	search for the epipoles, by far the most critical step, is carried
	out as a simple 1D optimization. Parameter initialization is trivial
	and completely automatic at all stages. After the estimation of the
	epipolar geometry, the Euclidean motion is recovered using the fixed
	intrinsic parameters of the camera obtained either from a calibration
	grid or from self-calibration techniques. Finally, the spinning object
	is reconstructed from its profiles using the motion estimated in
	the previous stage. Results from real data are presented, demonstrating
	the efficiency and usefulness of the proposed methods.},

	goals of the interlocutors. We first compare sequential models---in
	particular discrete hidden Markov models (DHMMs)---with standard
	classifiers (SVMs and decision trees). We propose a modification
	of the initialization of the DHMMs in order to better capture the
	recurrent structure of the sensory-motor states. We show that the
	explicit state duration modeling by discrete hidden semi markov models
	(DHSMMs) improves prediction performance. We applied these models
	to parallel speech and gaze data collected from interacting dyads.
	The challenge was to predict the gaze of one subject given the gaze
	of the interlocutor and the voice activity of both. For both DHMMs
	and DHSMMs the short-time Viterbi concept is used for incremental
	decoding and prediction. For the proposed models we evaluated objectively
	several properties in order to go beyond pure classification performance.
	Results show that incremental DHMMs (IDHMMs) were more efficient
	than classic classifiers and superseded by incremental DHSMMs (IDHSMMs).
	This later result emphasizes the relevance of state duration modeling.},

	Live reconstruction of the human form, from cameras surrounding the
	subject, could bridge the gap between video conferencing and Immersive
	Collaborative Virtual Environments (ICVEs). Video conferencing faithfully
	reproduces what someone looks like whereas ICVE faithfully reproduces
	what they look at. While 3D video has been demonstrated in tele-immersion
	prototypes, the visual/temporal quality has been way below what has
	become acceptable in video conferencing. Managed synchronization
	of the acquisition stage is universally used today to ensure multiple
	images feeding the reconstruction algorithm were taken at the same
	time. However, this inevitably increases latency and jitter. We measure
	the temporal characteristics of the capture stage and the impact
	of inconsistency on the reconstruction algorithm this feeds. This
	gives us both input and output characteristics for synchronization.
	From this we determine whether frame synchronization of multiple
	camera video streams actually needs to be delivered for 3D reconstruction,
	and if not what level of temporal divergence is acceptable across
	the captured image frames.},

	based system, images are captured at the same moment to ensure the
	position of the object is consistent in all frames. Differences in
	position between captured frames results in deformations such as
	holes and missing or extended features. By capturing images of a
	projected clock, we can tell with around 10ms granularity, how closely
	together images are captured. This gives us an indication of whether
	software capture triggers delivered over a network can be used for
	image acquisition in a 3D reconstruction system, instead of hardware
	synchronised capture.},

  abstract = {Abstract For efficient collaboration between participants, eye gaze
	is seen as being critical for interaction. Video conferencing either
	does not attempt to support eye gaze (e.g. AcessGrid) or only approximates
	it in round table conditions (e.g. life size telepresence). Immersive
	collaborative virtual environments represent remote participants
	through avatars that follow their tracked movements. By additionally
	tracking people's eyes and representing their movement on their avatars,
	the line of gaze can be faithfully reproduced, as opposed to approximated.
	This paper presents the results of initial work that tested if the
	focus of gaze could be more accurately gauged if tracked eye movement
	was added to that of the head of an avatar observed in an immersive
	VE. An experiment was conducted to assess the difference between
	user's abilities to judge what objects an avatar is looking at with
	only head movements being displayed, while the eyes remained static,
	and with eye gaze and head movement information being displayed.
	The results from the experiment show that eye gaze is of vital importance
	to the subjects correctly identifying what a person is looking at
	in an immersive virtual environment. This is followed by a description
	of the work that is now being undertaken following the positive results
	from the experiment. We discuss the integration of an eye tracker
	more suitable for immersive mobile use and the software and techniques
	that were developed to integrate the user's real-world eye movements
	into calibrated eye gaze in an immersive virtual world. This is to
	be used in the creation of an immersive collaborative virtual environment
	supporting eye gaze and its ongoing experiments. Copyright ? 2009

  abstract = {A stereo matching method that uses multiple stereo pairs with various
	baselines generated by a lateral displacement of a camera to obtain
	precise distance estimates without suffering from ambiguity is presented.
	Matching is performed simply by computing the sum of squared-difference
	(SSD) values. The SSD functions for individual stereo pairs are represented
	with respect to the inverse distance and are then added to produce
	the sum of SSDs. This resulting function is called the SSSD-in-inverse-distance.
	It is shown that the SSSD-in-inverse-distance function exhibits a
	unique and clear minimum at the correct matching position, even when
	the underlying intensity patterns of the scene include ambiguities
	or repetitive patterns. The authors first define a stereo algorithm
	based on the SSSD-in-inverse-distance and present a mathematical
	analysis to show how the algorithm can remove ambiguity and increase
	precision. Experimental results with real stereo images are presented
	to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.},

	rates of production. Although in the Relay Assembly Test Room experiment
	the experimental operations may have produced other extraneous variables,
	a reexamination based on new and neglected evidence has yielded a
	new interpretation. The new variable, made more plausible because
	research in other contexts has shown it to have similar effects,
	is a combination of information feedback and financial reward. It
	is an example of the control of behavior by its consequences. Although
	several approaches may be taken to explain the effects of response-consequence
	contingencies, I have favored operant conditioning because it seems
	to account for progressive increases in response rate-the Hawthorne
	phenomenon. Generalizing from the particular situation at Hawthorne,
	I would define the Hawthorne effect as the confounding that occurs
	if experimenters fail to realize how the consequences of subjects'
	performance affect what subjects do. But the Hawthorne effect need
	not be viewed solely as a problem in conducting experiments. The
	phenomenon that created it should be studied in its own right, as
	Sommer (67) suggested with a different phenomenon in mind. The study

	determined, the homography can be computed from the frontier points
	induced by epipolar tangencies. On the other hand, given the homography,
	the epipoles can be located directly from the bi-tangent lines of
	silhouettes. With the homography recovered, the image invariants
	under circular motion and camera parameters can be determined. If
	the epipoles are not available, camera parameters can be determined
	by a low-dimensional search of the optimal homography in a bounded
	region. In the degenerate case, when the camera optical axes intersect
	at one point, we derive a closed-form solution for the focal length
	to solve the problem. By using the proposed algorithm, we can achieve
	camera calibration simply from silhouettes of three images captured
	under circular motion. Experimental results on synthetic and real
	images are presented to show its performance.},

	Typically, these techniques depend on view-dependent texture mapping
	to render the textured 3D models in which the texture of novel views
	is synthesized at runtime according to different view-points. This
	is computationally expensive and limits their application in domains
	where efficient computations are required, such as games and virtual
	reality. In this paper we present an offline technique for creating
	view-independent texture atlases for 3D models, given a set of registered
	images. The best texture map resolution is computed by considering
	the areas of the projected polygons in the images. Texture maps are
	generated by a weighted composition of all available image information
	in the scene.Assuming that all surfaces of the model are exhibiting
	Lambertian reflectance properties, ray-tracing is then employed,
	for creating the view-independent texture maps. Finally, all the
	generated texture maps are packed into texture atlases. The result
	is a 3D model with an associated view-independent texture atlas which
	can be used efficiently in any application without any knowledge
	of camera pose information.},

	co-located social interaction. When we attempt to support tele-presence

	the targets of eye-gaze are only correct if the participants remain

	VC allow people to discern being looked at and what else is looked
	at, when someone gazes into their space from another location, ICVE
	alone can continue to do this as people move. The conditions of aligned
	VC, ICVE, eye-gaze enabled ICVE and co-location are compared. The
	impact of factors of alignment, lighting, resolution, and perspective
	distortion are minimised through a set of pilot experiments, before
	a formal experiment records results for optimal settings. Results

	challenge for communication technology, limiting effectiveness in
	many applications. Interpersonal distance, gaze, posture and facial
	expression, are interpreted together to manage and add meaning to
	most conversations. Yet today's technologies favor some above others.
	This induces confusion in conversations, and is believed to limit
	both feelings of togetherness and trust, and growth of empathy and
	rapport. Solving this problem will allow technologies to support
	most rather than a few interactional scenarios. It is likely to benefit
	teamwork and team cohesion, distributed decision-making and health
	and wellbeing applications such as tele-therapy, tele-consultation,
	and isolation. We introduce withyou, our telepresence research platform.
	This paper describes the end-to-end system including the psychology
	of human interaction and how this drives requirements throughout
	the design and implementation. Our technology approach is to combine
	the winning characteristics of video conferencing and immersive collaborative
	virtual environments. This is to allow, for example, people walking
	past each other to exchange a glance and smile. A systematic explanation
	of the theory brings together the linked nature of non-verbal communication
	and how it is influenced by technology. This leads to functional
	requirements for telepresence, in terms of the balance of visual,
	spatial and temporal qualities. The first end-to-end description
	of withyou describes all major processes and the display and capture
	environment. An unprecedented characterization of our approach is
	given in terms of the above qualities and what influences them. This
	leads to non-functional requirements in terms of number and place
	of cameras and the avoidance of resultant bottlenecks. Proposals
	are given for improved distribution of processes across networks,
	computers, and multi-core CPU and GPU. Simple conservative estimation
	shows that both approaches should meet our requirements. One is implemented

	Immersive Virtuality Telepresence has the potential to meet the grand
	challenge of faithfully communicating both the appearance and the
	focus of attention of a remote human participant within a shared
	3D computer-supported context. Within the experiment n=22 participants
	rotated static 3D virtuality humans, reconstructed from surround

	absolute angular error, which was compared to that underpinning social
	gaze behaviour in the natural world. Independent variables were 1)
	relative orientations of eye, head and body of captured subject;
	and 2) subset of cameras used to texture the form. Analysis looked
	for statistical and practical significance and qualitative corroborating
	evidence. The analysed results tell us much about the importance
	and detail of the relationship between gaze pose, method of video
	based reconstruction, and camera arrangement. They tell us that virtuality
	can reproduce gaze to an accuracy useful in social interaction, but
	with the adopted method of Video Based Reconstruction, this is highly
	dependent on combination of gaze pose and camera arrangement. This
	suggests changes in the VBR approach in order to allow more flexible

  abstract = {Collaboration and teamwork is important in many areas of our lives.
	People come together to share and discuss ideas, split and distribute
	work or help and support each other. The sharing of information and
	artefacts is a central part of collaboration. This often involves
	the manipulation of shared objects, both sequentially as well as
	concurrently. For coordinating an efficient collaboration, communication
	between the team members is necessary. This can happen verbally in
	form of speech or text and non-verbally through gesturing, pointing,
	gaze or facial expressions and the referencing and manipulation of
	shared objects. Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVE) allow remote
	users to come together and interact with each other and virtual objects
	within a computer simulated environment. Immersive display interfaces,
	such as a walk-in display (e.g. CAVE), that place a human physically
	into the synthetic environment, lend themselves well to support a
	natural manipulation of objects as well a set of natural non-verbal
	human communication, as they can both capture and display human movement.
	Communication of tracking data, however, can saturate the network
	and result in delay or loss of messages vital to the manipulation
	of shared objects. This paper investigates the reality of shared
	object manipulation between remote users collaborating through linked
	walk-in displays and extends our research in [27]. Various forms
	of shared interaction are examined through a set of structured sub
	tasks within a representative construction task. We report on extensive
	user-trials between three walk-in displays in the UK and Austria
	linked over the Internet using a CVE, and demonstrate such effects
	on a naive implementation of a benchmark application, the Gazebo
	building task. We then present and evaluate application-level workarounds
	and conclude by suggesting solutions that may be implemented within
	next-generation CVE infrastructures.},

	of people to violence in digital media, and in particular considers
	the issues of internal validity and ecological validity or generalisability
	of results to events in the real world. Experimental methods typically
	involve a significant level of abstraction from reality, with participants
	required to carry out tasks that are far removed from violence in
	real life, and hence their ecological validity is questionable. On
	the other hand studies based on field data, while having ecological
	validity, cannot control multiple confounding variables that may
	have an impact on observed results, so that their internal validity
	is questionable. It is argued that immersive virtual reality may
	provide a unification of these two approaches. Since people tend
	to respond realistically to situations and events that occur in virtual
	reality, and since virtual reality simulations can be completely
	controlled for experimental purposes, studies of responses to violence
	within virtual reality are likely to have both ecological and internal
	validity. This depends on a property that we call 'plausibility'
	- including the fidelity of the depicted situation with prior knowledge
	and expectations. We illustrate this with data from a previously
	published experiment, a virtual reprise of Stanley Milgram's 1960s
	obedience experiment, and also with pilot data from a new study being
	developed that looks at bystander responses to violent incidents.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Which factors contribute to effective meetings? The interaction
	among participants plays a key role. Interaction is a relational,
	interdependent process that constitutes social structure. Applying
	a network perspective to meeting interactions allows us to take account
	of the social structure. The aim of this study was to use social
	network analysis to distinguish functional and dysfunctional interaction
	structures and gain insight into the facilitation of meetings by
	analyzing antecedents and consequences of functional interaction
	structures. Data were based on a field study in which 51 regular
	meetings were videotaped and coded with act4teams. Analyses revealed
	that compared with dysfunctional networks, functional interaction
	is less centralized and has a positive effect on team performance.
	Social similarity has a crucial effect on functional interaction
	because participants significantly interact with others who are similar
	in personal initiative and self-efficacy. Our results provide important
	information about how to assist the interaction process and promote
	team success.},

	of the experience? is conjured up, and a set of questions administered

	that colorfulness of yesterday's experiences was associated with
	the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also associated
	with yesterday being a ?good?, ?pleasant?, but not frustrating day.
	The meaning lessness of this analysis illustrates that the equivalent
	methodology used by presence researchers, may, similarly, bring into
	being the idea of presence in the minds of VE participants. However,
	it is argued that there can be no evidence on this methodological
	basis that presence played any role in their actual mental activity

	The purpose of the experiment was not to examine task performance,
	but to compare various aspects of the social relations among the
	group members in the two environments. Ten groups of three people
	each, who had never met before, met first in a shared VE and carried
	out a task that required the identification and solution of puzzles
	that were presented on pieces of paper displayed around the walls
	of a room. The puzzle involved identifying that the same-numbered
	words across all the pieces of paper formed a riddle or saying. The
	group continued this task for fifteen minutes, and then stopped to
	answer a questionnaire. The group then reconvened in the real world
	and continued the same task. The experiment also required one of
	the group members to continually monitor a particular one of the
	others in order to examine whether social discomfort could be generated
	within a VE. In each group, there was one immersed person with a
	head-mounted display and head-tracking and two non-immersed people
	who experienced the environment on a workstation display. The results
	suggest that the immersed person tended to emerge as the leader in
	the virtual group, but not in the real meeting. Group accord tended
	to be higher in the real meeting than in the virtual meeting. Socially
	conditioned responses such as embarrassment could be generated in
	the virtual meeting, even though the individuals were presented to
	one another by very simple avatars. The study also found a positive
	relationship between presence of being in a place and copresence
	- the sense of being with the other people. Accord in the group increased
	with presence, the performance of the group, and the presence of
	women in the group. The study is seen as part of a much larger planned

	words across all the pieces of paper formed a riddle or saying. The
	group continued this task for fifteen minutes, and then stopped to
	answer a questionnaire. The group then reconvened in the real world
	and continued the same task. The experiment also required one of
	the group members to continually monitor a particular one of the
	others in order to examine whether social discomfort could be generated
	within a VE. In each group, there was one immersed person with a
	head-mounted display and head-tracking and two non-immersed people
	who experienced the environment on a workstation display. The results
	suggest that the immersed person tended to emerge as the leader in
	the virtual group, but not in the real meeting. Group accord tended
	to be higher in the real meeting than in the virtual meeting. Socially
	conditioned responses such as embarrassment could be generated in
	the virtual meeting, even though the individuals were presented to
	one another by very simple avatars. The study also found a positive
	relationship between presence of being in a place and copresence?the
	sense of being with the other people. Accord in the group increased
	with presence, the performance of the group, and the presence of
	women in the group. The study is seen as part of a much larger planned
	study, for which this experiment was used to begin to understand
	the issues involved in comparing real and virtual meetings.},

	predictors. In addition he reports recent experimental results: In
	order to determine how well we can predict a subject's focus of attention
	solely on the basis of his or her head orientation, he has conducted
	an experiment in which he recorded head and eye orientations of participants

  abstract = {The Uncanny Valley Hypothesis (UVH) describes the sudden change in
	a person's affect from affinity to aversion that is evoked by robots
	that border a human-like appearance. The portion of the human-likeness
	spectrum in which such aversion is posited to occur is referred to
	as the ``uncanny valley''. However, evidence in support of the UVH
	is primarily based on subjectively assessed evaluations. Thus it
	remains an open question as to whether there are behavioral or neurophysiological
	manifestations of uncanny valley effects. To address this gap in
	literature, we investigated the activation of the anterior prefrontal
	cortex (PFC) - a region of the brain associated with emotion regulation
	- in response to a series of robots with varying human-likeness.
	We hypothesized that highly human-like robots - which have been found
	to receive negative subjective attributions - will also elicit increased
	activity in the PFC versus humans or robots with lesser degrees of
	human-likeness in accordance with the UVH. Our results show a ``valley''
	in brain activity in the PFC corresponding to the valley observed
	via subjective measures alone, thus suggesting one neural manifestation
	(the PFC) of uncanny valley effects and further supporting the affective
	response (aversion) posited to occur by the UVH. However, the results
	also reveal a second ``uncanny valley'' in prefrontal hemodynamics,
	which suggests that the effects (and the contributing factors) are
	more complex than previously understood.},

	orientation shift needed to compensate for it, and evaluated the

	the face did not affect IAOS. The most effective cue was the location
	of the visible outline of the face. IAOS seems to be due to a shift
	of this outline when shadowed areas on the face merge with the black
	background. We conclude that an important mechanism for orientation

	to pass a ?reality test? whereby under current conditions the presence
	scores should be higher for real experiences than for virtual ones.
	Nevertheless, only the SUS had a marginally higher mean score for
	the real compared to the virtual, and there was no significant difference
	at all between the WS mean scores. It is concluded that, although
	such questionnaires may be useful when all subjects experience the

	Further, it is hypothesized that isotropy increases social nearness

	and task outcome of two discussion tasks under isotropic and (standard)
	non-isotropic videoconferencing conditions relative to face-to-face
	conditions. The communication of unshared information was tested

	were revealed using a prioritization game of survival items called

	support our hypotheses and have revealed that persuasive force (the
	ability to change another person's opinion) is significantly stronger
	under isotropic conditions (including face-to-face) than under non-isotropic
	conditions. In contrast, dominance (the ability to influence group
	solutions by dominant behavior) is similar for all conditions. Further,
	participants communicate almost twice as much unshared information

	task that requires expert skills. The planning, training and analysis
	of on-orbit servicing (OOS) missions performed by astronauts or through
	remote operation using a robot is often time consuming and costly.
	Virtual Reality (VR) enables simulation and training in a flexible
	and safe environment. This paper describes an interactive real-time
	environment that supports a number of OOS tasks within an immersive
	VR environment. The system simulates the dynamic and kinematic behaviour
	of satellite components and provides photo-realistic visualization
	of satellite parts and the space environment. It integrates user
	interaction with haptic force feedback through a bi-manual haptic
	human machine interface, as well as simulates and interfaces to a
	humanoid robot for tele-operation.In order to provide a realistic
	experience at interactive frame rates, we propose a distributed system
	architecture, where the load of computing the physics simulation,
	haptic feedback and visualization of the complex scene is transferred
	to dedicated machines. The modular architecture is designed to allow
	the inclusion of further simulation processes. Several mechanisms
	for reducing the communication traffic have been implemented. This
	paper gives an overview of the system architecture, outlines the
	software implementation and documents an evaluation of the real-time
	performance of our system in detail. We describe how system performance
	was measured in terms of simulation timings and distribution load,
	as well as report on latencies at several stages. Results show that
	our distributed system is capable of providing visual and haptic
	feedback at high frame rates required for user interaction with end-to-end

	what each other are doing but follow each otherpsilas eyes, even
	when walking about. Projected into each space are avatar representations
	of remote participants, that reproduce not only body, head and hand
	movements, but also those of the eyes. Spatial and temporal alignment
	of remote spaces allows the focus of gaze as well as activity and
	gesture to be used as a resource for non-verbal communication. The
	temporal challenge met was to reproduce eye movements quick enough
	and often enough to interpret their focus during a multi-way interaction,
	along with communicating other verbal and non-verbal language. The
	spatial challenge met was to maintain communicational eye gaze while
	allowing free movement of participants within a virtually shared
	common frame of reference. This paper reports on the technical and
	especially temporal characteristics of the system.},

  abstract = {The human activity monitoring is one of the major tasks in the field
	of computer vision. Recently, not only the 2D images but also 3D
	shapes of a moving person are desired in kinds of cases, such as
	motion analysis, security monitoring, 3D video creation and so on.
	In this paper, we propose a parallel pipeline system on a PC cluster
	for reconstructing the 3D shape of a moving person in real-time.
	For the 3D shape reconstruction, we have extended the volume intersection
	method to the 3-base-plane volume intersection. By thus extension,
	the computation is accelerated greatly for arbitrary camera layouts.
	We also parallelized the 3-base-plane method and implemented it on
	a PC cluster. On each node, the pipeline processing is adopted to
	improve the throughput. To decrease the CPU idle time caused by I/O
	processing, image capturing, communications over nodes and so on,
	we implement the pipeline using multiple threads. So that, all stages
	can be executed concurrently. However, there exists resource conflicts
	between stages in a real system. To avoid the conflicts while keeping
	high percentage of CPU running time, we propose a tree structured
	thread control model. As a result, We achieve the performance as
	obtaining the full 3D volumes of a moving person at about 12 frames
	per second, where the voxel size is 5$\times$5$\times$5 [mm^3]. The
	effectiveness of the thread tree model in such real-time computation
	is also proved by the experimental results.},

	eye contact than female-female dyads, and (3) decreases in IPD are

	in the evolutionary origins of the human mind and its neurotic and
	psychotic disorders. In common with many writers then and now, he
	believed that the evolutionary past is conserved in the mind and
	the brain. Today the ``evolutionary Freud'' is nearly forgotten.
	Even among Freudians, he is regarded to be a red herring, relevant
	only to the extent that he diverts attention from the enduring achievements
	of the authentic Freud. There are three ways to explain these attitudes.
	First, the evolutionary Freud's key work is the ``Overview of the
	Transference Neurosis'' (1915). But it was published at an inopportune
	moment, forty years after the author's death, during the so-called
	``Freud wars.'' Second, Freud eventually lost interest in the ``Overview''
	and the prospect of a comprehensive evolutionary theory of psychopathology.
	The publication of The Ego and the Id (1923), introducing Freud's
	structural theory of the psyche, marked the point of no return. Finally,
	Freud's evolutionary theory is simply not credible. It is based on
	just-so stories and a thoroughly discredited evolutionary mechanism,
	Lamarckian use-inheritance. Explanations one and two are probably
	correct but also uninteresting. Explanation number three assumes
	that there is a fundamental difference between Freud's evolutionary
	narratives (not credible) and the evolutionary accounts of psychopathology
	that currently circulate in psychiatry and mainstream journals (credible).
	The assumption is mistaken but worth investigating.},

	objects are of interest, this approach effectively reduces the overall
	computation cost quite significantly and preserves the high definition
	details. Estimating depth from stereo is a classic computer vision
	problem, which has received tremendous attention since the early
	days. Recovering 3D information from a pair of stereo cameras has
	been a popular topic because the additional 3D information provided
	by this technology contains significantly more information than 2D
	information produced by traditional cameras. Some believe that this
	technology will fundamentally revolutionize the computer vision signal-processing
	pipeline, as well as how future cameras will be built. The current
	implementation achieves 36 Hz stereo matching on 1024 $\times$ 768
	stereo video with a fine 256-pixel disparity range. The focus of
	this work is to provide efficient high-resolution stereo algorithms
	for real-time applications in which only foreground moving objects
