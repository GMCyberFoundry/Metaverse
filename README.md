# Metaverse

## Purpose

The Metaverse repository was created to explore ways that small and medium sized enterprises could benefit from secure economic activity within global metaverse applications. It is not a turnkey solution but rather a collection of literature, free and open-source software, and best practice. It is designed to inform a curious company using a [single book format resource](https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse/raw/draft/Book/metaverseBTC.pdf), and a [how-to guide](https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse/tree/main/Lab).

The most up to date direct PDF download is [direct linked here](https://github.com/GMCyberFoundry/Metaverse/raw/draft/Book/metaverseBTC.pdf), and you should use this if you just arrived from Twitter etc.

This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) GM Cyber Foundry Project (15R18P02426)
