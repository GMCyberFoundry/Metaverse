# Metaverse

## Purpose

The Metaverse repository was created to explore ways that small and medium sized enterprises could benefit from secure economic activity within global metaverse applications. It is not a turnkey solution but rather a collection of literature, free and open-source software, and best practice. It is designed to inform a curious company using a single book format resource, a how-to guide, and a set of downloadable scripts.

This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) GM Cyber Foundry Project (15R18P02426)
